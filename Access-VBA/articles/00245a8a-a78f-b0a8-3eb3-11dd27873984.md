[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns a value that specifies whether or not the value of a  **[Field](47282ce2-9b49-ccf9-ad37-c4bb25cfd037.md)** object is immediately validated when the object's **[Value](6c0f9a8d-f51a-b8cf-8830-f8d960a1d08c.md)** property is set (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ValidateOnSet**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Field** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Only  **Field** objects in **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** objects support the **ValidateOnSet** property as read/write.

Setting the  **ValidateOnSet** property to **True** can be useful in a situation when a user is entering records that include substantial Memo data. Waiting until the **[Update](aad4171a-da95-ed72-86b3-714615ea0ac8.md)** call to validate the data can result in unnecessary time spent writing the lengthy Memo data to the database if it turns out that the data was invalid anyway because a validation rule was broken in another field.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **ValidateOnSet** property to demonstrate how one might trap for errors during data entry. The ValidateData function is required for this procedure to run.
