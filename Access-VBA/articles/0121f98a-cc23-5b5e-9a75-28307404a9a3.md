## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **StillExecuting**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Connection** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use the  **StillExecuting** property to determine if the most recently called asynchronous **Execute** or **OpenConnection** method (that is, a method executed with the **dbRunAsync** option) is complete. While the **StillExecuting** property is **True**, any returned object cannot be accessed.

Once the  **StillExecuting** property returns **False**, following the **OpenConnection** call that returns the associated **Connection** object, the object can be referenced. So long as **StillExecuting** remains **True**, the object may not be referenced, other than to read the **StillExecuting** property.

Use the  **[Cancel](43ad7b64-823d-3fac-e4d4-5e9514f60011.md)** method to terminate execution of a task in progress.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **StillExecuting** property and the **Cancel** method to asynchronously open a **Connection** object.


```
Sub CancelConnectionX() 
 
 Dim wrkMain As Workspace 
 Dim conMain As Connection 
 Dim sngTime As Single 
 
 Set wrkMain = CreateWorkspace("ODBCWorkspace", _ 
 "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
 ' Open the connection asynchronously. 
 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 Set conMain = wrkMain.OpenConnection("Publishers", _ 
 dbDriverNoPrompt + dbRunAsync, False, _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
 
 sngTime = Timer 
 
 ' Wait five seconds. 
 Do While Timer - sngTime < 5 
 Loop 
 
 ' If the connection has not been made, ask the user 
 ' if she wants to keep waiting. If she does not, cancel 
 ' the connection and exit the procedure. 
 Do While conMain.StillExecuting 
 
 If MsgBox("No connection yet--keep waiting?", _ 
 vbYesNo) = vbNo Then 
 conMain.Cancel 
 MsgBox "Connection cancelled!" 
 wrkMain.Close 
 Exit Sub 
 End If 
 
 Loop 
 
 With conMain 
 ' Use the Connection object conMain. 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 wrkMain.Close 
 
End Sub 

```
