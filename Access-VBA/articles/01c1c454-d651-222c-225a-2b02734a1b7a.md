Changes the password of an existing Microsoft Access database engine database (Microsoft Access workspaces only).


## Syntax

 _expression_. **NewPassword**( ** _bstrOld_**, ** _bstrNew_** )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **Database** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _bstrOld_|Required|**String**|The current setting of the  **Password** property of the **Database** object.|
| _bstrNew_|Required|**String**|The new setting of the  **Password** property of the **Database** object.
 **Note**  Use strong passwords that combine upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Weak passwords don't mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Use a strong password that you can remember so that you don't have to write it down.

|

## Remarks



The bstrOld and bstrNew strings can be up to 20 characters long and can include any characters except the ASCII character 0 (null). To clear the password, use a zero-length string ("") for bstrNew.

Passwords are case-sensitive.

If a database has no password, the Microsoft Access database engine will automatically create one by passing a zero-length string ("") for the old password.


 **Important**  If you lose your password, you can never open the database again.
