# The width of a Unicode text column must be an even number of bytes. (Error 3702)

The database stores data using the Unicode character set, in which each character is a word (two-byte) value. Columns for text must be declared to be an even number of bytes wide so that the columns can hold an exact number of Unicode characters.



- If this error message appears during database creation, the program that is attempting to create an incorrect database should be corrected.
    
- If this error message appears during normal run time, it is probable that the database has become corrupted and needs to be compacted or repaired.
