 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates, in a hierarchical [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object, whether the reference to the underlying child records (that is, the _chapter_ ) changes when the parent row position changes.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a  **Boolean** value. The default value is **True**. If **True**, the chapter will be updated if the parent **Recordset** object changes row position; if **False**, the chapter will continue to refer to data in the previous chapter even though the parent **Recordset** object has changed row position.


## Remarks

This property applies to hierarchical Recordsets, such as those supported by the [Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB](6e6e5f39-6f43-7c7b-5812-796096d1d31b.md), and must be set on the parent  **Recordset** before the child **Recordset** is retrieved. This property simplifies navigating hierarchical recordsets.
