Update behavior and functionality is largely dependent upon update mode (lock type), cursor type, and cursor location.

Use the  **Update** method to save any changes you have made to the current record of a **Recordset** object since calling the **AddNew** method or since changing any field values in an existing record. The **Recordset** object must support updates.
If the  **Recordset** object supports batch updating, you can cache multiple changes to one or more records locally until you call the **UpdateBatch** method. If you are editing the current record or adding a new record when you call the **UpdateBatch** method, ADO will automatically call the **Update** method to save any pending changes to the current record before transmitting the batched changes to the provider.
The current record remains current after you call the  **Update** or **UpdateBatch** methods.
