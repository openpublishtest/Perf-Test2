# Customization File Connect Section

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

The default behavior of the handler is to deny all connections. The  **connect** section specifies exceptions to that behavior. For example, if all the **connect** sections were absent or empty, then by default no connections could be made.

The  **connect** section can contain:

- A default access entry that specifies the default read and write operations allowed on this connection. If there is no default access entry in the section, the section will be ignored.
    
- A new connection string that replaces the client connection string.
    

## Syntax

A default access entry is of the form:


```
Access=accessRight
```

A replacement connection string entry is of the form:




```
Connect=connectionString
```
