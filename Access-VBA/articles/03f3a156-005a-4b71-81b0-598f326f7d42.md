# DBEngine.CompactDatabase Method (DAO)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Copies and compacts a closed database, and gives you the option of changing its version, collating order, and encryption. (Microsoft Access workspaces only). .


## Syntax

 _expression_. **CompactDatabase**( ** _SrcName_**, ** _DstName_**, ** _DstLocale_**, ** _Options_**, ** _password_** )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **DBEngine** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _SrcName_|Required|**String**|Identifies an existing, closed database. It can be a full path and file name, such as "C:\db1.mdb". If the file name has an extension, you must specify it. If your network supports it, you can also specify a network path, such as "\\server1\share1\dir1\db1.mdb"|
| _DstName_|Required|**String**|the file name (and path) of the compacted database that you're creating. You can also specify a network path. You can't use this argument to specify the same database file as SrcName.|
| _DstLocale_|Optional|**Variant**|A string expression that specifies a collating order for creating DstName, as specified in Remarks.
<ul xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p>If you omit this argument, the locale of DstName is the same as SrcName. </p></li><li><p>You can also create a password for DstName by concatenating the password string (starting with "<span class="code">;pwd=</span>") with a constant in the DstLocale argument, like this: <span class="code">dbLangSpanish &amp; ";pwd=NewPassword"</span>.</p></li><li><p>If you want to use the same DstLocale as SrcName (the default value), but specify a new password, simply enter a password string for DstLocale: <span class="code">";pwd=NewPassword"</span></p></li></ul>|
| _Options_|Optional|**Variant**|Optional. A constant or combination of constants that indicates one or more options, as specified in Remarks. You can combine options by summing the corresponding constants.|
| _password_|Optional|**Variant**|A string expression containing a password, if the database is password protected. The string ";pwd=" must precede the actual password. If you include a password setting in DstLocale, this setting is ignored.
 **Note**  Use strong passwords that combine upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Weak passwords don't mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Use a strong password that you can remember so that you don't have to write it down.

## Remarks

You can use one of the following constants for the DstLocale argument to specify the  **CollatingOrder** property for string comparisons of text.

You can use one of the following constants in the options argument to specify whether to encrypt or to decrypt the database while it's compacted.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**dbEncrypt**|Encrypt the database while compacting.|
|**dbDecrypt**|Decrypt the database while compacting.|
If you omit an encryption constant or if you include both  **dbDecrypt** and **dbEncrypt**, DstName will have the same encryption as SrcName.

You can use one of the following constants in the options argument to specify the version of the data format for the compacted database. This constant affects only the version of the data format of DstName and doesn't affect the version of any Microsoft Access-defined objects, such as forms and reports.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**dbVersion10**|Creates a database that uses the Microsoft Jet database engine version 1.0 file format while compacting.|
|**dbVersion11**|Creates a database that uses the Microsoft Jet database engine version 1.1 file format while compacting.|
|**dbVersion20**|Creates a database that uses the Microsoft Jet database engine version 2.0 file format while compacting.|
|**dbVersion30**|Creates a database that uses the Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0 file format (compatible with version 3.5) while compacting.|
|**dbVersion40**|Creates a database that uses the Microsoft Jet database engine version 4.0 file format while compacting.|
|**dbVersion120**|Creates a database that uses the Microsoft Access database engine version 12.0 file format while compacting.|
You can specify only one version constant. If you omit a version constant, DstName will have the same version as SrcName. You can compact DstName only to a version that is the same or later than that of SrcName.

As you change data in a database, the database file can become fragmented and use more disk space than is necessary. Periodically, you can use the  **CompactDatabase** method to compact your database to defragment the database file. The compacted database is usually smaller and often runs faster. You can also change the collating order, the encryption, or the version of the data format while you copy and compact the database.

You must close SrcName before you compact it. In a multiuser environment, other users can't have SrcName open while you're compacting it. If SrcName isn't closed or isn't available for exclusive use, an error occurs.

Because  **CompactDatabase** creates a copy of the database, you must have enough disk space for both the original and the duplicate databases. The compact operation fails if there isn't enough disk space available. The DstName duplicate database doesn't have to be on the same disk as SrcName. After successfully compacting a database, you can delete the SrcName file and rename the compacted DstName file to the original file name.

The  **CompactDatabase** method copies all the data and the security permission settings from the database specified by SrcName to the database specified by DstName.


 **Note**  Because the  **CompactDatabase** method doesn't convert Microsoft Access objects, you shouldn't use **CompactDatabase** to convert a database containing such objects.
