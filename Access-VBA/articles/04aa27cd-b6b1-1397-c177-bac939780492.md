# Determine Whether The Current Record is a New Record In a Form

The following example shows how to use the  **NewRecord** property to determine if the current record is a new record. The **NewRecordMark** procedure sets the current record to the variable _intnewrec_. If the record is new, a message notifies the user. You could call this procedure when the[Current](44961599-2B0A-874E-BE64-1E29F47F839F.md) event for a form occurs.


```
Sub NewRecordMark(frm As Form) 
    Dim intnewrec As Integer 
 
    intnewrec = frm.NewRecord 
    If intnewrec = True Then 
    MsgBox "You're in a new record." _ 
        &amp; "@Do you want to add new data?" _ 
        &amp; "@If not, move to an existing record." 
    End If 
End Sub 

```
