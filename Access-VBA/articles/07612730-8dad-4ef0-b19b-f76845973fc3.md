# Field2.ValidateOnSet Property (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

 **In this article**
[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns a value that specifies whether or not the value of a  **Field2** object is immediately validated when the object's **Value** property is set (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ValidateOnSet**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Field2** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Only  **Field2** objects in **Recordset** objects support the **ValidateOnSet** property as read/write.

Setting the  **ValidateOnSet** property to **True** can be useful in a situation when a user is entering records that include substantial Memo data. Waiting until the **Update** call to validate the data can result in unnecessary time spent writing the lengthy Memo data to the database if it turns out that the data was invalid anyway because a validation rule was broken in another field.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **ValidateOnSet** property to demonstrate how one might trap for errors during data entry. The ValidateData function is required for this procedure to run.
