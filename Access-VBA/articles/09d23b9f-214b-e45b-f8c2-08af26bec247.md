# Use Default Paper Size Property

You can use the  **Use Default Paper Size** property to specify whether or not the default paper size of the current printer is used when you print a form or report.


## Setting

The  **Use Default Paper Size** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Yes**|Use the default paper size of the current printer when printing the form or report.|
|**No**|(Default) Use the paper size specified when the form or report was designed when printing the form or report.|

## Remarks

By default, when you print a form or report, Access uses the paper size that was specified when the form or report was designed. This can cause problems when the form or report is printed on a printer that uses a different default paper size. For example, you might design a form or report while connected to a printer that has a default paper size of A4. An error might occur when you print the form or report on a printer that has a default paper size of Letter. Setting the  **Use Default Paper Size** property to **Yes** prevents this problem from occurring.
