When creating virtual servers in Internet Information Services 4.0, the following two extra steps are needed in order to configure the virtual server to work with RDS:


1. When setting up the server, check "Allow Execute Access."
    
2. Move msadcs.dll to  _vroot_ \msadc, where _vroot_ is the home directory of your virtual server.
