 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the type of asynchronous fetching.

## Setting and Return Values

Sets or returns one of the following values.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**adcFetchUpFront**|All the records of the [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) are fetched before control is returned to the application. The complete **Recordset** is fetched before the application is allowed to do anything with it.|
|**adcFetchBackground**|Control can return to the application as soon as the first batch of records has been fetched. A subsequent read of the  **Recordset** that attempts to access a record not fetched in the first batch will be delayed until the sought record is actually fetched, at which time control returns to the application.|
|**adcFetchAsync**|Default. Control returns immediately to the application while records are fetched in the background. If the application attempts to read a record that hasn't yet been fetched, the record closest to the sought record will be read and control will return immediately, indicating that the current end of the  **Recordset** has been reached. For example, a call to[MoveLast](32ef8fa9-c096-b4e7-3396-b88a6a9bd1a2.md) will move the current record position to the last record actually fetched, even though more records will continue to populate the **Recordset**.|

 **Note**  Each client-side executable file that uses these constants must provide declarations for them. You can cut and paste the constant declarations you want from the file Adcvbs.inc, located in the C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\MSADC folder.


## Remarks

In a Web application, you will usually want to use  **adcFetchAsync** (the default value), because it provides better performance. In a compiled client application, you will usually want to use **adcFetchBackground**.
