## The IADORecordBinding Interface
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The Microsoft Visual C++ Extensions for ADO associate, or bind, fields of a [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object to C/C++ variables. Whenever the current row of the bound **Recordset** changes, all the bound fields in the **Recordset** are copied to the C/C++ variables. If necessary, the copied data is converted to the declared data type of the C/C++ variable.

The  **BindToRecordset** method of the **IADORecordBinding** interface binds fields to C/C++ variables. The **AddNew** method adds a new row to the bound **Recordset**. The **Update** method populates fields in new rows of the **Recordset**, or updates fields in existing rows, with the value of the C/C++ variables.

The  **IADORecordBinding** interface is implemented by the **Recordset** object. You do not code the implementation yourself.


## Binding Entries
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The Visual C++ Extensions for ADO map fields of a [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object to C/C++ variables. The definition of a mapping between a field and a variable is called a _binding entry_. Macros provide binding entries for numeric, fixed-length, and variable-length data. The binding entries and C/C++ variables are declared in a class derived from the Visual C++ Extensions class, **CADORecordBinding**. The **CADORecordBinding** class is defined internally by the binding entry macros.

ADO internally maps the parameters in these macros to an OLE DB  **DBBINDING** structure and creates an OLE DB **Accessor** object to manage the movement and conversion of data between fields and variables. OLE DB defines data as consisting of three parts: A _buffer_ where the data is stored; a _status_ that indicates whether a field was successfully stored in the buffer, or how the variable should be restored to the field; and the _length_ of the data. (See the _OLE DB Programmer's Reference_, Chapter 6: Getting and Setting Data for more information.)


## Header File
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Include the following file in your application in order to use the Visual C++ Extensions for ADO:


```
 
#include <icrsint.h> 

```


## Binding Recordset Fields
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

 **To Bind Recordset Fields to C/C++ Variables**


1. Create a class derived from the  **CADORecordBinding** class.
    
2. Specify binding entries and corresponding C/C++ variables in the derived class. Bracket the binding entries between  **BEGIN_ADO_BINDING** and **END_ADO_BINDING** macros. Do not terminate the macros with commas or semicolons. Appropriate delimiters are specified automatically by each macro. Specify one binding entry for each field to be mapped to a C/C++ variable. Use an appropriate member from the **ADO_FIXED_LENGTH_ENTRY**, **ADO_NUMERIC_ENTRY**, or **ADO_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENTRY** family of macros.
    
3. In your application, create an instance of the class derived from  **CADORecordBinding**. Get the **IADORecordBinding** interface from the **Recordset**. Then call the **BindToRecordset** method to bind the **Recordset** fields to the C/C++ variables.
    
See the [Visual C++ Extensions Example](fe57868f-5707-3c5b-cb93-4121732d67cc.md) for more information.


## Interface Methods
<a name="sectionSection4"> </a>

The  **IADORecordBinding** interface has three methods: **BindToRecordset**, **AddNew**, and **Update**. The sole argument to each method is a pointer to an instance of the class derived from **CADORecordBinding**. Therefore, the **AddNew** and **Update** methods cannot specify any of the parameters of their ADO method namesakes.

 **Syntax**

The  **BindToRecordset** method associates the **Recordset** fields with C/C++ variables.




```
BindToRecordset(CADORecordBinding *binding ) 

```

The  **AddNew** method invokes its namesake, the ADO[AddNew](bae09be0-5707-4f38-9c74-0acd0f29dbac.md) method, to add a new row to the **Recordset**.




```
AddNew(CADORecordBinding *binding ) 

```

The  **Update** method invokes its namesake, the ADO[Update](fc88cab6-c379-bb4f-530c-da08107924e0.md) method, to update the **Recordset**.




```
Update(CADORecordBinding *binding ) 

```


## Binding Entry Macros
<a name="sectionSection5"> </a>

Binding entry macros define the association of a  **Recordset** field and a variable. A beginning and ending macro delimits the set of binding entries.

Families of macros are provided for fixed-length data, such as  **adDate** or **adBoolean**; numeric data, such as **adTinyInt**, **adInteger**, or **adDouble**; and variable-length data, such as **adChar**, **adVarChar** or **adVarBinary**. All numeric types, except for **adVarNumeric**, are also fixed-length types. Each family has differing sets of parameters so that you can exclude binding information that is of no interest.

See the  _OLE DB Programmer's Reference,_ Appendix A: Data Types for additional information.

 ** _Begin Binding Entries_**

 **BEGIN_ADO_BINDING** ( _Class_ )

 ** _Fixed-Length Data_**

 **ADO_FIXED_LENGTH_ENTRY** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Status, Modify_ ) **ADO_FIXED_LENGTH_ENTRY2** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Modify_ )

 ** _Numeric Data_**

 **ADO_NUMERIC_ENTRY** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Precision, Scale, Status, Modify_ ) **ADO_NUMERIC_ENTRY2** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Precision, Scale, Modify_ )

 ** _Variable-Length Data_**

 **ADO_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENTRY** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Size, Status, Length, Modify_ ) **ADO_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENTRY2** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Size, Status, Modify_ ) **ADO_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENTRY3** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Size, Length, Modify_ ) **ADO_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ENTRY4** ( _Ordinal, DataType, Buffer, Size, Modify_ )

 ** _End Binding Entries_**

 **END_ADO_BINDING** ()



|**Parameter**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _Class_|Class in which the binding entries and C/C++ variables are defined.|
| _Ordinal_|Ordinal number, counting from one, of the  **Recordset** field corresponding to your C/C++ variable.|
| _DataType_|Equivalent ADO data type of the C/C++ variable (see [DataTypeEnum](a8ab7616-552f-ed5f-ed55-95254cfb374a.md) for a list of valid data types). The value of the **Recordset** field will be converted to this data type if necessary.|
| _Buffer_|Name of the C/C++ variable where the  **Recordset** field will be stored.|
| _Size_|Maximum size in bytes of  _Buffer_. If _Buffer_ will contain a variable-length string, allow room for a terminating zero.|
| _Status_|Name of a variable that will indicate whether the contents of  _Buffer_ are valid, and whether the conversion of the field to _DataType_ was successful. The two most important values for this variable are **adFldOK**, which means the conversion was successful; and **adFldNull**, which means the value of the field would be a VARIANT of type VT_NULL and not merely empty. Possible values for _Status_ are listed in the next table, "Status Values."|
| _Modify_|Boolean flag; if TRUE, indicates ADO is allowed to update the corresponding  **Recordset** field with the value contained in _Buffer_. Set the Boolean _modify_ parameter to TRUE to enable ADO to update the bound field, and FALSE if you want to examine the field but not change it.|
| _Precision_|Number of digits that can be represented in a numeric variable.|
| _Scale_|Number of decimal places in a numeric variable.|
| _Length_|Name of a four-byte variable that will contain the actual length of the data in  _Buffer_.|

## Status Values
<a name="sectionSection6"> </a>

The value of the  _Status_ variable indicates whether a field was successfully copied to a variable.

When setting data,  _Status_ may be set to **adFldNull** to indicate the **Recordset** field should be set to null.



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**adFldOK**|0|A non-null field value was returned.|
|**adFldBadAccessor**|1|Binding was invalid.|
|**adFldCantConvertValue**|2|Value couldn't be converted for reasons other than sign mismatch or data overflow.|
|**adFldNull**|3|When getting a field, indicates a null value was returned. When setting a field, indicates the field should be set to  **NULL** when the field cannot encode **NULL** itself (for example, a character array or an integer).|
|**adFldTruncated**|4|Variable-length data or numeric digits were truncated.|
|**adFldSignMismatch**|5|Value is signed and variable data type is unsigned.|
|**adFldDataOverFlow**|6|Value is larger than could be stored in the variable data type.|
|**adFldCantCreate**|7|Unknown column type and field already open.|
|**adFldUnavailable**|8|Field value could not be determined â€” for example, on a new, unassigned field with no default value.|
|**adFldPermissionDenied**|9|When updating, no permission to write data.|
|**adFldIntegrityViolation**|10|When updating, field value would violate column integrity.|
|**adFldSchemaViolation**|11|When updating, field value would violate column schema.|
|**adFldBadStatus**|12|When updating, invalid status parameter.|
|**adFldDefault**|13|When updating, a default value was used.|
