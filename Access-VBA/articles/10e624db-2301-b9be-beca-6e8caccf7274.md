Returns a value that indicates whether a  **[Property](a1ecb0db-bb93-a7b5-23c3-0b73f275dfe0.md)** object is inherited from an underlying object.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Inherited**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Property** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For built-in  **Property** objects that represent predefined properties, the only possible return value is **False**.

You can use the  **Inherited** property to determine whether a user-defined **Property** was created for the object it applies to, or whether the **Property** was inherited from another object. For example, suppose you create a new **Property** for a **[QueryDef](0b3d901c-345d-42a2-f5f1-fb09cc562e27.md)** object and then open a **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object from the **QueryDef** object. This new **Property** will be part of the **Recordset** object's **[Properties](cd07184a-a261-29c9-542f-bc2eff6f4af6.md)** collection, and its **Inherited** property will be set to **True** because the property was created for the **QueryDef** object, not the **Recordset** object.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example use the  **Inherited** property to determine if a user-defined **Property** object was created for a **Recordset** object or for some underlying object.


```
Sub InheritedX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim tdfTest As TableDef 
 Dim rstTest As Recordset 
 Dim prpNew As Property 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 ' Create a new property for a saved TableDef object, then 
 ' open a recordset from that TableDef object. 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set tdfTest = dbsNorthwind.TableDefs(0) 
 Set prpNew = tdfTest.CreateProperty("NewProperty", _ 
 dbBoolean, True) 
 tdfTest.Properties.Append prpNew 
 Set rstTest = tdfTest.OpenRecordset(dbOpenForwardOnly) 
 
 ' Show Name and Inherited property of the new Property 
 ' object in the TableDef. 
 Debug.Print "NewProperty of " &amp; tdfTest.Name &amp; _ 
 " TableDef:" 
 Debug.Print " Inherited = " &amp; _ 
 tdfTest.Properties("NewProperty").Inherited 
 
 ' Show Name and Inherited property of the new Property 
 ' object in the Recordset. 
 Debug.Print "NewProperty of " &amp; rstTest.Name &amp; _ 
 " Recordset:" 
 Debug.Print " Inherited = " &amp; _ 
 rstTest.Properties("NewProperty").Inherited 
 
 ' Delete new TableDef because this is a demonstration. 
 tdfTest.Properties.Delete prpNew.Name 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 

```
