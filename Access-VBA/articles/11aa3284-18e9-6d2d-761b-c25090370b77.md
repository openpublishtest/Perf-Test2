 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the database name from which the query and update operations are run.
You can set the  **Connect** property at design time in the[RDS.DataControl](ac430669-7628-696c-c036-b5d35405d788.md) object's OBJECT tags, or at run time in scripting code (for instance, VBScript).

## Syntax

Design time:  `<PARAM NAME="Connect" VALUE="ConnectionString">`

Run time:  `DataControl.Connect = "ConnectionString"`


## Parameters


-  _ConnectionString_
    
- A valid connection string. For more general information about connection strings, see the [ConnectionString](c67a7daf-258f-d99d-6475-a4aa98d1e99d.md) property or your provider documentation.
    
     **Note**  Specifying MS Remote as the provider for the  **RDS.DataControl** would create a four-tier scenario. Scenarios greater than three tiers have not been tested and should not be needed.
-  _DataControl_
    
- An object variable that represents an  **RDS.DataControl** object.
