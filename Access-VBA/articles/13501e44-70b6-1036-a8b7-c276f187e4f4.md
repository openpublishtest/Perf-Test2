|:-----|:-----|
|[Axis](a4332b69-8900-08f1-a4e2-9395d005ed42.md)|Represents a positional or filter axis of a cellset, containing selected members of one or more dimensions.|
|[Catalog](708c4082-3589-7f3b-5ea3-f3705f3d3ff1.md)|Contains multidimensional schema information (that is, cubes and underlying dimensions, hierarchies, levels, and members) specific to a multidimensional data provider (MDP).|
|[Cell](b9d00b71-1f40-5bd1-4b89-fbdb59c552ba.md)|Represents the data at the intersection of axis coordinates, contained in a cellset.|
|[Cellset](28d4b3b9-f907-9ec0-00e1-9666c887cdf0.md)|Represents the results of a multidimensional query. It is a collection of cells selected from cubes or other cellsets.|
|[CubeDef](199235b7-3d98-f655-27bc-94f66e994e06.md)|Represents a cube from a multidimensional schema, containing a set of related dimensions.|
|[Dimension](12f43cfc-c74e-a2e8-7f6e-75fc68472c4b.md)|Represents one of the dimensions of a multidimensional cube, containing one or more hierarchies of members.|
|[Hierarchy](26e4e690-59ad-fb87-66b0-f3310df42d0c.md)|Represents one way in which the members of a dimension can be aggregated or "rolled up." A dimension can be aggregated along one or more hierarchies.|
|[Level](ddbcabce-8777-1068-98a3-be209084f497.md)|Contains a set of members, each of which has the same rank within a hierarchy.|
|[Member](d80c024a-07dc-7a35-f8f2-b4d5b19d89e4.md)|Represents a member of a level in a cube, the children of a member of a level, or a member of a position along an axis of a cellset.|
|[Position](f8d33cbf-6196-cce4-a140-75521677f1f4.md)|Represents a set of one or more members of different dimensions that defines a point along an axis.|
Also, the  **Catalog** object is connected to an ADO **Connection** object, which is included with the standard ADO library:


|**Object**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md)|Represents an open connection to a data source.|
Many ADO MD objects can be contained in a corresponding collection. For example, a [CubeDef](199235b7-3d98-f655-27bc-94f66e994e06.md) object can be contained in a[CubeDefs](31adca99-7c4f-7393-4bab-bcb38bcfc2ac.md) collection of a **Catalog**. For more information, see[ADO MD Collections](dc7df649-80bb-b517-f084-2bfa780fb2f8.md).
