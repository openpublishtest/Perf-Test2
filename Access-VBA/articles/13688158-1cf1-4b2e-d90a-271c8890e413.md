# PrintOut Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **PrintOut** action to print the active object in the open database. You can print datasheets, reports, forms, data access pages, and modules.


 **Note**  This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the  **See Also** section of this article.


## Setting

The  **PrintOut** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Print Range**|The range to print. Click  **All** (the user can print all of the object), **Selection** (the user can print the part of the object that's selected), or **Pages** (the user can specify a range of pages in the **Page From** and **Page To** arguments) in the **Print Range** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the Macro Builder pane. The default is **All**.|
|**Page From**|The first page to print. Printing starts at the top of this page. This argument is required if you select  **Pages** in the **Print Range** box.|
|**Page To**|The last page to print. Printing stops at the bottom of this page. This argument is required if you select  **Pages** in the **Print Range** box.|
|**Print Quality**|The print quality. Click  **High**,  **Medium**,  **Low**, or  **Draft**. The lower the quality, the faster the object prints. The default is  **High**.|
|**Copies**|The number of copies to print. The default is 1.|
|**Collate Copies**|Click  **Yes** (collate the printed copies) or **No** (do not collate copies). The object may print faster if this argument is set to **No**. The default is  **Yes**.|

## Remarks

This action is similar to selecting an object, clicking the  **File** tab and then clicking **Print**. With this action, however, no  **Print** dialog box appears.


 **Tip**  If you have particular print settings you use frequently, create a macro containing a  **PrintOut** action with these settings in its arguments.

The arguments for this action correspond to options in the  **Print** dialog box. However, unlike the **FindRecord** action and **Find and Replace** dialog box, the argument settings aren't shared with the **Print** dialog box options.

To run the  **PrintOut** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **PrintOut** method of the **DoCmd** object.
