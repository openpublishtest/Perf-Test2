The  **Before Delete** event occurs when a record is deleted, but before the change is committed.


 **Note**  The  **Before Delete** event is available only in Data Macros.


## Remarks

You can use access a value in the record to be deleted by using the following syntax.




```
[Old].[Field Name ]
```

For example, to access the value of the QuantityInStock field in the record to be deleted, use the following syntax.




```
[Old].[QuantityInStock]
```

The values contained in the record to be deleted are deleted permanently when the  **Before Delete** event ends.

You can cancel the  **Before Delete** event by using the **RaiseError** action. When an error is raised the changes contained in the **Before Delete** event are discarded.
