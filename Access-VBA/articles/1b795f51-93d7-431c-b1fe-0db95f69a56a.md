# Provider Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the name of the provider for a [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a  **String** value that indicates the provider name.


## Remarks

Use the  **Provider** property to set or return the name of the provider for a connection. This property can also be set by the contents of the[ConnectionString](c67a7daf-258f-d99d-6475-a4aa98d1e99d.md) property or the _ConnectionString_ argument of the[Open](1adaa17d-dfe1-22e0-3415-720516d138f8.md) method; however, specifying a provider in more than one place while calling the **Open** method can have unpredictable results. If no provider is specified, the property will default to MSDASQL ([Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC](c507567e-5ad1-b32a-f6ad-5ba2c39aa4c2.md)).

The  **Provider** property is read/write when the connection is closed and read-only when it is open. The setting does not take effect until you either open the **Connection** object or access the[Properties](4d662790-1252-c930-e6f9-edf6a38636af.md) collection of the **Connection** object. If the setting is not valid, an error occurs.
