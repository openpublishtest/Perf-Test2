# You cannot establish or maintain an enforced relationship between a replicated table and a local table. (Error 3453)

You are attempting to establish or maintain an enforced relationship between a replicated table and a non-replicated table. Replication does not allow an enforced relationship between:



- A replicated table and a local table.
    
- Two local tables that you are making replicable.
    
- Two tables with different  **KeepLocal** property settings.
    

Delete the relationship between the two tables before proceeding.
