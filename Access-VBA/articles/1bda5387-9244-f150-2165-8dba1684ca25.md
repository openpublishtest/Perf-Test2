# Report.DrawWidth Property (Access)

You can use the  **DrawWidth** property to specify the line width for the **[Line](9e640e37-c055-3dc3-b70e-0805cdc13561.md)**, **[Circle](4f5d24e2-75bf-3586-7e0d-0902adee61a6.md)**, and **[Pset](951a262b-b17b-9b95-b5f2-922d4aff9ce9.md)** methods to print lines on reports. Read/write **Integer**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DrawWidth**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


## Remarks

You can set the  **DrawWidth** property to an **Integer** value of 1 through 32,767. This value represents the width of the line in pixels. The default is 1, or 1 pixel wide.

You can set this property in an event procedure specified by a section's **OnPrint** property setting.

Increase the value of this property to increase the width of the line. If the  **DrawWidth** property setting is greater than 3, **[DrawMode](773a3c7f-fb59-9614-3363-b417607fbe28.md)** property settings 1 through 4 produce a solid line (the **DrawStyle** property setting isn't changed). Setting the **DrawWidth** property to 1 enables the **DrawStyle** property to produce the results shown in the setting table of the **DrawStyle** property.
