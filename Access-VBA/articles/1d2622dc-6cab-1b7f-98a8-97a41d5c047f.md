# LockType Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the type of locks placed on records during editing.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a [LockTypeEnum](966b4952-5591-4a99-82d5-99cb9ae3fc72.md) value. The default value is **adLockReadOnly**.


## Remarks

Set the  **LockType** property before opening a[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) to specify what type of locking the provider should use when opening it. Read the property to return the type of locking in use on an open **Recordset** object.

Providers may not support all lock types. If a provider cannot support the requested  **LockType** setting, it will substitute another type of locking. To determine the actual locking functionality available in a **Recordset** object, use the[Supports](2b4062ce-44df-4e84-1ce9-d6618c10c2af.md) method with **adUpdate** and **adUpdateBatch**.

The  **adLockPessimistic** setting is not supported if the[CursorLocation](8a048bd4-ae25-a555-1c07-14364b7e6560.md) property is set to **adUseClient**. If an unsupported value is set, then no error will result; the closest supported **LockType** will be used instead.

The  **LockType** property is read/write when the **Recordset** is closed and read-only when it is open.

 **Remote Data Service Usage** When used on a client-side Recordset object, the **LockType** property can only be set to **adLockBatchOptimistic**.
