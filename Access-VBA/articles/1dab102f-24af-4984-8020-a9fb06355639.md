# RequeryRecords Macro Action (Access custom web app)
You can use the  **RequeryRecords** action to refresh, sort, and filter the data in the active view by requerying the source of the view.

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

## Setting

The  **RequeryRecords** action has the following arguments.



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Where=**|No|A SQL WHERE clause that restricts the records in the view. By default, this argument is blank.|
|**OrderBy**|No|A string expression that includes the name of the field or fields on which to sort records and the optional ASC or DESC keywords. By default, this argument is blank.|

## Remarks

Any sorting or filtering applied by the user is cleared when the  **RequeryRecords** action is called.

The  _OrderBy_ argument is the name of the field or fields on which you want to sort records. When you use more than one field name, separate the names with a comma (,).

When you set the  _OrderBy_ argument, the records are sorted by default in ascending order.

To sort records in descending order, enter DESC at the end of the  _OrderBy_ argument expression. For example, to sort customer records in descending order by contact name, set the _OrderBy_ argument to "ContactName DESC".

To sort names by LastName descending, and FirstName ascending, set the  _OrderBy_ argument to "LastName DESC, FirstName ASC".
