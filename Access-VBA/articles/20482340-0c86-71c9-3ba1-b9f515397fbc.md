# Hide a Subform if the Main Form Contains No Records

The following example illustrates how to hide a subform named  _Orders_Subform_ if its main form does not contain any records. The code resides in the main form's **[Current](44961599-2B0A-874E-BE64-1E29F47F839F.md)** event procedure.


```
Private Sub Form_Current() 
 
    With Me![Orders_Subform].Form 
     
        ' Check the RecordCount of the Subform. 
        If .RecordsetClone.RecordCount = 0 Then 
         
            ' Hide the subform. 
            .Visible = False 
         
        End If 
    End With 
End Sub
```
