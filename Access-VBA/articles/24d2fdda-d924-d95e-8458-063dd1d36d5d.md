# Field2.SourceTable Property (DAO)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Returns a value that indicates the name of the table that is the original source of the data for a  **Field2** object. Read-only **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **SourceTable**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Field2** object.


## Remarks

For a  **Field2** object, use of the **SourceField** and **SourceTable** properties depends on the object that contains the **Fields** collection that the **Field2** object is appended to, as shown in the following table.



|**Object appended to**|**Usage**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Index**|Not supported|
|**QueryDef**|Read-only|
|**Recordset**|Read-only|
|**Relation**|Not supported|
|**TableDef**|Read-only|
These properties indicate the original field and table names associated with a  **Field2** object. For example, you could use these properties to determine the original source of the data in a query field whose name is unrelated to the name of the field in the underlying table.


 **Note**  The  **SourceTable** property will not return a meaningful table name if used on a **Field2** object in the **Fields** collection of a table-type **Recordset** object.
