# Property.Value Property (DAO)

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Sets or returns the value of an object. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Value**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Property** object.


## Remarks

The setting or return value is a Variant data type that evaluates to a value appropriate for the data type, as specified by the  **Type** property of an object.

Generally, the  **Value** property is used to retrieve and alter data in **Recordset** objects.

The  **Value** property is the default property of the **Field**, **Parameter**, and **Property** objects. Therefore, you can set or return the value of one of these objects by referring to them directly instead of specifying the **Value** property.

Trying to set or return the  **Value** property in an inappropriate context (for example, the **Value** property of a **Field** object in the **Fields** collection of a **TableDef** object) will cause a trappable error.


 **Note**  When reading decimal values from a Microsoft SQL Server database, they will be formatted using scientific notation through a Microsoft Access workspace, but will appear as normal decimal values through an ODBCDirect workspace.
