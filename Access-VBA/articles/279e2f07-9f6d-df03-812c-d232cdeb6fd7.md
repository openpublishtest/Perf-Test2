# List Box Control

The list box control displays a list of values or alternatives. In many cases, it's quicker and easier to select a value from a list than to remember a value to type. A list of choices also helps ensure that the value that's entered in a field is correct.

The list in a list box consists of rows of data. Rows can have one or more columns, which can appear with or without headings.

## Remarks

If a multiple-column list box is bound, Microsoft Access stores the values from one of the columns.

You can use an unbound list box to store a value that you can use with another control. For example, you could use an unbound list box to limit the values in another list box or in a custom dialog box. You could also use an unbound list box to find a record based on the value you select in the list box.

If you don't have room on your form to display a list box, or if you want to be able to type new values as well as select values from a list, use a combo box instead of a list box.
