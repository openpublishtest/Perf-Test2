Creates a make-table query.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

SELECT  _field1_ [, _field2_ [, …]] INTO _newtable_ [IN _externaldatabase_ ] FROM _source_

The SELECT…INTO statement has these parts:



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _field1_, _field2_|The name of the fields to be copied into the new table.|
| _newtable_|The name of the table to be created. It must conform to standard naming conventions. If  _newtable_ is the same as the name of an existing table, a trappable error occurs.|
| _externaldatabase_|The path to an external database. For a description of the path, see the [IN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5bca25c0-cd00-140f-79b8-80cd2d0c190b%28Office.15%29.aspx) clause.|
| _source_|The name of the existing table from which records are selected. This can be single or multiple tables or a query.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use make-table queries to archive records, make backup copies of your tables, or make copies to export to another database or to use as a basis for reports that display data for a particular time period. For example, you could produce a Monthly Sales by Region report by running the same make-table query each month.


 **Note**  


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example selects all records in the Employees table and copies them into a new table named Emp Backup.


```
Sub SelectIntoX() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database 
    Dim qdf As QueryDef 
 
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    ' Select all records in the Employees table  
    ' and copy them into a new table, Emp Backup. 
    dbs.Execute "SELECT Employees.* INTO " _ 
        &amp; "[Emp Backup] FROM Employees;" 
         
    ' Delete the table because this is a demonstration. 
    dbs.Execute "DROP TABLE [Emp Backup];" 
     
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```
