|**adFldCacheDeferred**|0x1000|Indicates that the provider caches field values and that subsequent reads are done from the cache.|
|**adFldFixed**|0x10|Indicates that the field contains fixed-length data.|

|**adFldIsCollection**|0x40000|Indicates that the field specifies that the resource represented by the record is a collection of other resources, such as a folder, rather than a simple resource, such as a text file.|
|**adFldIsDefaultStream**|0x20000|Indicates that the field contains the default stream for the resource represented by the record. For example, the default stream can be the HTML content of a root folder on a Web site, which is automatically served when the root URL is specified.|

|**adFldIsRowURL**|0x10000|Indicates that the field contains the URL that names the resource from the data store represented by the record.|

|**adFldNegativeScale**|0x4000|Indicates that the field represents a numeric value from a column that supports negative scale values. The scale is specified by the [NumericScale](51b232d2-5bfd-521c-f4e9-65655ecc7c70.md) property.|
|**adFldRowID**|0x100|Indicates that the field contains a persistent row identifier that cannot be written to and has no meaningful value except to identify the row (such as a record number, unique identifier, and so forth).|
|**adFldRowVersion**|0x200|Indicates that the field contains some kind of time or date stamp used to track updates.|
|**adFldUnknownUpdatable**|0x8|Indicates that the provider cannot determine if you can write to the field.|
