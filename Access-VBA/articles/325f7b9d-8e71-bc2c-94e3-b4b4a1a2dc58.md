# RDS Returns "Stream Not Read" Error

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

"The Stream object could not be read because it is empty, or the current position is at the end of the Stream. For non-empty Streams, set the current position with the Position property. To determine if a Stream is empty, check the Size property."

If you get the error above, it may be a result of trying to use a parameterized hierarchical query over http. RDS does not permit you to remote parameterized hierarchies.
