# Prepared Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates whether to save a compiled version of a command before execution.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a  **Boolean** value that, if set to **True**, indicates that the command should be prepared.


## Remarks

Use the  **Prepared** property to have the provider save a prepared (or compiled) version of the query specified in the[CommandText](0debec1c-068f-0aea-fce8-e61aa39c5907.md) property before a[Command](64f4ef03-f858-c004-b891-0c96d13a5e6e.md) object's first execution. This may slow a command's first execution, but once the provider compiles a command, the provider will use the compiled version of the command for any subsequent executions, which will result in improved performance.

If the property is  **False**, the provider will execute the **Command** object directly without creating a compiled version.

If the provider does not support command preparation, it may return an error as soon as this property is set to  **True**. If it does not return an error, it simply ignores the request to prepare the command and sets the **Prepared** property to **False**.
