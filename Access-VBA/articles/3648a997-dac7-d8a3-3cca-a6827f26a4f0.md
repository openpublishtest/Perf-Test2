# Persisting Filtered and Hierarchical Recordsets

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

If the [Filter](5abc528a-a6ee-34de-5d44-a3249194b0a0.md) property is in effect for the **Recordset**, only the rows accessible under the filter are saved. If the **Recordset** is hierarchical, the current child **Recordset** and its children are saved, including the parent **Recordset**. If the **Save** method of a child **Recordset** is called, the child and all its children are saved, but the parent is not. For more information about hierarchical **Recordsets**, see[Chapter 9: Data Shaping](f66a319f-1b3d-c4a3-50b3-af1a47540832.md).


 **Note**  Some limitations apply when saving hierarchical  **Recordsets** (data shapes) in XML format. For more information, see[Hierarchical Recordsets in XML](606dee87-8762-6cc2-a151-94d34031b35f.md).
