[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a  **[QueryDef](0b3d901c-345d-42a2-f5f1-fb09cc562e27.md)** object that is a copy of the **QueryDef** used to create the **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object represented by the _recordset_ placeholder (Microsoft Access workspaces only). .

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **CopyQueryDef**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


### Return Value

QueryDef


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use the  **CopyQueryDef** method to create a new **QueryDef** that is a duplicate of the **QueryDef** used to create the **Recordset**.

If a  **QueryDef** wasn't used to create this **Recordset**, an error occurs. You must first open a **Recordset** with the **OpenRecordset** method before using the **CopyQueryDef** method.

This method is useful when you create a  **Recordset** object from a **QueryDef**, and pass the **Recordset** to a function, and the function must re-create the SQL equivalent of the query, for example, to modify it in some way.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **CopyQueryDef** method to create a copy of a **QueryDef** from an existing **Recordset** and modifies the copy by adding a clause to the SQL property. When you create a permanent **QueryDef**, spaces, semicolons, or linefeeds may be added to the SQL property; these extra characters must be stripped before any new clauses can be attached to the SQL statement.


```
Function CopyQueryNew(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
 strAdd As String) As QueryDef 
 
 Dim strSQL As String 
 Dim strRightSQL As String 
 
 Set CopyQueryNew = rstTemp.CopyQueryDef 
 With CopyQueryNew 
 ' Strip extra characters. 
 strSQL = .SQL 
 strRightSQL = Right(strSQL, 1) 
 Do While strRightSQL = " " Or strRightSQL = ";" Or _ 
 strRightSQL = Chr(10) Or strRightSQL = vbCr 
 strSQL = Left(strSQL, Len(strSQL) - 1) 
 strRightSQL = Right(strSQL, 1) 
 Loop 
 .SQL = strSQL &amp; strAdd 
 End With 
 
End Function

This example shows a possible use of CopyQueryNew().
