# FindRecord Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **FindRecord** action to find the first instance of data that meets the criteria specified by the **FindRecord** arguments. This data can be in the current record, in a succeeding or prior record, or in the first record. You can find records in the active table datasheet, query datasheet, form datasheet, or form.


## Setting

The  **FindRecord** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Find What**|Specifies the data you want to find in the record. Enter the text, number, or date you want to find or type an expression, which is preceded by an equal sign ( **=** ), in the **Find What** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the Macro Builder pane. You can use wildcard characters. This is a required argument.|
|**Match**|Specifies where the data is located in the field. You can specify a search for data in any part of the field ( **Any Part of Field**), for data that fills the entire field ( **Whole Field**), or for data located at the beginning of the field ( **Start of Field**). The default is  **Whole Field**.|
|**Match Case**|Specifies whether the search is case-sensitive. Click  **Yes** (conduct a case-sensitive search) or **No** (search without matching uppercase and lowercase letters exactly). The default is **No**.|
|**Search**|Specifies whether the search proceeds from the current record up to the beginning of the records ( **Up**); down to the end of the records ( **Down**); or down to the end of the records and then from the beginning of the records to the current record, so all records are searched ( **All**). The default is  **All**.|
|**Search As Formatted**|Specifies whether the search includes formatted data. Click  **Yes** (Microsoft Office Access 2007 searches for the data as it is formatted and displayed in the field) or **No** (Access searches for the data as it is stored in the database, which isn't always the same as it's displayed). The default is **No**. You can use this feature to restrict the search to data in a particular format. For example, click  **Yes** and type **1,234** in the **Find What** argument to find a value of 1,234 in a field formatted to include commas. Click **No** if you want to type **1234** to search for the data in this field. To search for dates, click **Yes** to find a date exactly as it is formatted, such as 08-July-2003. If you click **No**, enter the date for the  **Find What** argument in the format that is set in the regional settings in Windows Control Panel. This format is shown in the **Short date format** box found on the **Date** tab in the regional settings. For example, if the **Short date format** box is set to **M/d/yy**, you can enter 7/8/03, and Access will find all entries in a Date field that correspond to July 8, 2003, regardless of how this field is formatted.
 **Note**  The  **Search As Formatted** argument takes effect only if the current field is a bound control, the **Match** argument is set to **Whole Field**, the  **Only Current Field** argument is set to **Yes**, and the  **Match Case** argument is set to **No**.

If you set  **Match Case** to **Yes** or **Only Current Field** to **No**, you must also set  **Search As Formatted** to **Yes**.|
|**Only Current Field**|Specifies whether the search is confined to the current field in each record or includes all fields in each record. Searching in the current field is faster. Click  **Yes** (confine the search to the current field) or **No** (search in all fields in each record). The default is **Yes**.|
|**Find First**|Specifies whether the search starts at the first record or at the current record. Click  **Yes** (start at the first record) or **No** (start at the current record). The default is **Yes**.|

## Remarks

When a macro runs the  **FindRecord** action, Access searches for the specified data in the records (the order of the search is determined by the setting of the **Search** argument). When Access finds the specified data, the data is selected in the record.

The  **FindRecord** action is equivalent to clicking **Find** on the **Home** tab, and its arguments are the same as the options in the **Find and Replace** dialog box. If you set the **FindRecord** arguments in the Macro Builder pane and then run the macro, you will see the corresponding options selected in the **Find and Replace** dialog box when you click **Find**.

Access retains the most recent  **FindRecord** arguments during a database session so that you don't need to enter the same criteria repeatedly as you perform subsequent operations with the **FindRecord** action. If you leave an argument blank, Access uses the most recent setting for the argument, as set either by a previous **FindRecord** action or in the **Find and Replace** dialog box.

When you want to find a record by using a macro, use the  **FindRecord** action, not the **RunMenuCommand** action with its argument set to run the **Find** command.


 **Note**  While the  **FindRecord** action corresponds to the **Find** command on the **Home** tab for tables, queries, and forms, it doesn't correspond to the **Find** command on the **Edit** menu in the Code window. You can't use the **FindRecord** action to search for text in modules.

If the currently selected text is the same as the search text at the time the  **FindRecord** action is carried out, the search begins immediately following the selection in the same field as the selection, and in the same record. Otherwise, the search begins at the start of the current record. This enables you to find multiple instances of the same search criteria that might appear in a single record.

However, note that if you use a command button to run a macro containing the  **FindRecord** action, the first instance of the search criteria will be found repeatedly. This behavior occurs because clicking the command button removes the focus from the field containing the matching value. The **FindRecord** action will then begin searching from the start of the record. To avoid this problem, run the macro by using a technique that doesn't change the focus, such as a custom toolbar button or a key combination defined in an AutoKeys macro, or set the focus in the macro to the field containing the search criteria before you carry out the **FindRecord** action.


 **Security Note**  



The same behavior also occurs if you use a command button to run a macro containing the  **FindNext** action.

To run the  **FindRecord** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **FindRecord** method of the **DoCmd** object.

For more complex searches, you may want to use the  **SearchForRecord** macro action.
