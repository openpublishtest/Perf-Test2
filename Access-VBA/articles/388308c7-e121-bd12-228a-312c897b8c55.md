# Recordset-Related Error Information

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

During batch processing, the  **Status** property of the **Recordset** object provides information about the individual records in the **Recordset**. Before a batch update takes place, the **Status** property of the **Recordset** reflects information about records to be added, changed and deleted. After **UpdateBatch** has been called, the **Status** property indicates the success or failure of the operation. As you move from record to record in the **Recordset,** the value of the **Status** property changes to describe the status of the current record.
