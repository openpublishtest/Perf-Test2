## Saving to the XML DOM Object

You can save a  **Recordset** in XML format to an instance of an MSXML DOM object, as shown in the following Visual Basic code:


```
 
Dim xDOM As New MSXML.DOMDocument 
Dim rsXML As New ADODB.Recordset 
Dim sSQL As String, sConn As String 
     
sSQL = "SELECT customerid, companyname, contactname FROM customers" 
sConn="Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=D:\Program Files" &amp; _ 
        "\Common Files\System\msadc\samples\NWind.mdb" 
rsXML.Open sSQL, sConn 
rsXML.Save xDOM, adPersistADO   'Save Recordset directly into a DOM tree. 
... 

```
