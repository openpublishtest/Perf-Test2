# DoCmd Object (Access)

You can use the methods of the  **DoCmd** object to run Microsoft Office Access actions from Visual Basic. An action performs tasks such as closing windows, opening forms, and setting the value of controls.


## Remarks

For example, you can use the  **OpenForm** method of the **DoCmd** object to open a form, or use the **Hourglass** method to change the mouse pointer to an hourglass icon.

Most of the methods of the  **DoCmd** object have arguments â€” some are required, while others are optional. If you omit optional arguments, the arguments assume the default values for the particular method. For example, the **OpenForm** method uses seven arguments, but only the first argument, _FormName_, is required. The following example shows how you can open the Employees form in the current database. Only employees with the title Sales Representative are included.




```
DoCmd.OpenForm "Employees", , ,"[Title] = 'Sales Representative'"
```

The  **DoCmd** object doesn't support methods corresponding to the following actions:


- AddMenu.
    
- MsgBox. Use the  **MsgBox** function.
    
- RunApp. Use the  **Shell** function to run another application.
    
- RunCode. Run the function directly in Visual Basic.
    
- SendKeys. Use the  **SendKeys** statement.
    
- SetValue. Set the value directly in Visual Basic.
    
- StopAllMacros.
    
- StopMacro.
    

## Example

The following example opens a form in Form view and moves to a new record.


```
Sub ShowNewRecord() 
 DoCmd.OpenForm "Employees", acNormal 
 DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acNewRec 
End Sub
```
