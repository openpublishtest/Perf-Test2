[Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns the name of the foreign table in a relationship (Microsoft Access workspaces only). .

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ForeignTable**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Relation** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 This property is read/write for a new **[Relation](46d6dfaf-a97d-3abd-0b4b-396a41eb3be7.md)** object not yet appended to a collection and read-only for an existing **Relation** object in the **[Relations](8929b5cc-cf52-03f2-8cf5-7f45276d258e.md)** collection.

The  **ForeignTable** property setting of a **Relation** object is the **[Name](5f4a95cd-63a3-aedf-df64-793158b2283d.md)** property setting of the **[TableDef](715146b6-c62a-abff-28ee-e6bbe3c08adf.md)** or **[QueryDef](0b3d901c-345d-42a2-f5f1-fb09cc562e27.md)** object that represents the foreign table or query; the **[Table](cc4f64ef-c4e9-1a14-9263-5f8220d89840.md)** property setting is the **Name** property setting of the **TableDef** or **QueryDef** object that represents the primary table or query.

For example, if you had a list of valid part codes (in a field named PartNo) stored in a ValidParts table, you could establish a relationship with an OrderItem table such that if a part code were entered into the OrderItem table, it would have to already be in the ValidParts table. If the part code didn't exist in the ValidParts table and you had not set the  **[Attributes](8e6f6afb-1a89-7315-c129-cf7ff19e0ca9.md)** property of the **Relation** object to **dbRelationDontEnforce**, a trappable error would occur.

In this case, the ValidParts table is the primary table, so the  **Table** property of the **Relation** object would be set to ValidParts and the **ForeignTable** property of the **Relation** object would be set to OrderItem. The **Name** and **ForeignName** properties of the **Field** object in the **Relation** object's **Fields** collection would be set to PartNo.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example shows how the  **Table**, **ForeignTable**, and **ForeignName** properties define the terms of a **Relation** between two tables.


```
Sub ForeignNameX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim relLoop As Relation 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 Debug.Print "Relation" 
 Debug.Print " Table - Field" 
 Debug.Print " Primary (One) "; 
 Debug.Print ".Table - .Fields(0).Name" 
 Debug.Print " Foreign (Many) "; 
 Debug.Print ".ForeignTable - .Fields(0).ForeignName" 
 
 ' Enumerate the Relations collection of the Northwind 
 ' database to report on the property values of 
 ' the Relation objects and their Field objects. 
 For Each relLoop In dbsNorthwind.Relations 
 With relLoop 
 Debug.Print 
 Debug.Print .Name &amp; " Relation" 
 Debug.Print " Table - Field" 
 Debug.Print " Primary (One) "; 
 Debug.Print .Table &amp; " - " &amp; .Fields(0).Name 
 Debug.Print " Foreign (Many) "; 
 Debug.Print .ForeignTable &amp; " - " &amp; _ 
 .Fields(0).ForeignName 
 End With 
 Next relLoop 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 

```
