# OpenDiagram Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

In an Access project, you can use the  **OpenDiagram** action to open a database diagram in Design view.


 **Note**  This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the  **See Also** section of this article.


## Setting

The  **OpenDiagram** action has the following argument.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Diagram Name**|The name of the database diagram to open. The  **Diagram Name** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the Macro Builder pane shows all database diagrams in the current database. This is a required argument. If you run a macro containing the **OpenDiagram** action in a library database, Microsoft Access first looks for the diagram with this name in the library database, and then in the current database.|

## Remarks

This action is similar to double-clicking a database diagram in the Navigation Pane, or right-clicking the database diagram in the Navigation Pane and then clicking  **Design View**.


 **Tip**  You can drag a database diagram from the Navigation Pane to a macro action row. This automatically creates an  **OpenDiagram** action that opens the database diagram in Design view.

To run the  **OpenDiagram** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **OpenDiagram** method of the **DoCmd** object.
