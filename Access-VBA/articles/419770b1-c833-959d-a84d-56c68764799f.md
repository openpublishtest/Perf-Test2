Creates a crosstab query.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

TRANSFORM  _aggfunction_ _selectstatement_ PIVOT _pivotfield_ [IN ( _value1_ [, _value2_ [, …]])]

The TRANSFORM statement has these parts:



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _aggfunction_|An [SQL aggregate function](8866cd71-0216-25b4-6a6a-02cb7acad9a2.md) that operates on the selected data.|
| _selectstatement_|A [SELECT](a5c9da94-5f9e-0fc0-767a-4117f38a5ef3.md) statement.|
| _pivotfield_|The field or expression you want to use to create column headings in the query's result set.|
| _value1_, _value2_|Fixed values used to create column headings.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

When you summarize data using a crosstab query, you select values from specified fields or expressions as column headings so you can view data in a more compact format than with a select query.

TRANSFORM is optional but when included is the first statement in an SQL string. It precedes a SELECT statement that specifies the fields used as row headings and a [GROUP BY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fe7d5e27-a47a-1229-232c-cf6a0cbad761%28Office.15%29.aspx) clause that specifies row grouping. Optionally, you can include other clauses, such as[WHERE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/67e4caed-6512-e8bd-39d0-6dca18114b18%28Office.15%29.aspx), that specify additional selection or sorting criteria. You can also use subqueries as predicates — specifically, those in the WHERE clause — in a crosstab query.

The values returned in  _pivotfield_ are used as column headings in the query's result set. For example, pivoting the sales figures on the month of the sale in a crosstab query would create 12 columns. You can restrict _pivotfield_ to create headings from fixed values ( _value1_, _value2_ ) listed in the optional IN clause. You can also include fixed values for which no data exists to create additional columns.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the SQL TRANSFORM clause to create a crosstab query showing the number of orders taken by each employee for each calendar quarter of 1994. The SQLTRANSFORMOutput function is required for this procedure to run.


```
Sub TransformX1() 
 
    Dim dbs As Database 
    Dim strSQL As String 
    Dim qdfTRANSFORM As QueryDef 
 
    strSQL = "PARAMETERS prmYear SHORT; TRANSFORM " _ 
        &amp; "Count(OrderID) " _ 
        &amp; "SELECT FirstName &amp; "" "" &amp; LastName AS " _ 
        &amp; "FullName FROM Employees INNER JOIN Orders " _ 
        &amp; "ON Employees.EmployeeID = " _ 
        &amp; "Orders.EmployeeID WHERE DatePart " _ 
        &amp; "(""yyyy"", OrderDate) = [prmYear] " 
   
       strSQL = strSQL &amp; "GROUP BY FirstName &amp; " _ 
        &amp; """ "" &amp; LastName " _ 
        &amp; "ORDER BY FirstName &amp; "" "" &amp; LastName " _ 
        &amp; "PIVOT DatePart(""q"", OrderDate)" 
     
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
    Set qdfTRANSFORM = dbs.CreateQueryDef _ 
        ("", strSQL) 
     
    SQLTRANSFORMOutput qdfTRANSFORM, 1994 
     
    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
```

This example uses the SQL TRANSFORM clause to create a slightly more complex crosstab query showing the total dollar amount of orders taken by each employee for each calendar quarter of 1994. The SQLTRANSFORMOutput function is required for this procedure to run.

        &amp; "Sum(Subtotal) SELECT FirstName &amp; "" """ _ 
        &amp; "&amp; LastName AS FullName " _ 
        &amp; "FROM Employees INNER JOIN " _ 
        &amp; "(Orders INNER JOIN [Order Subtotals] " _ 
        &amp; "ON Orders.OrderID = " _ 
        &amp; "[Order Subtotals].OrderID) " _ 
        &amp; "ON Employees.EmployeeID = " _ 
        &amp; "Orders.EmployeeID WHERE DatePart" _ 
        &amp; "(""yyyy"", OrderDate) = [prmYear] " 
    
       strSQL = strSQL &amp; "GROUP BY FirstName &amp; "" """ _ 
        &amp; "&amp; LastName " _ 
        &amp; "ORDER BY FirstName &amp; "" "" &amp; LastName " _ 
        &amp; "PIVOT DatePart(""q"",OrderDate)"         
         
    ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
    ' on your computer. 
    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")

            .MoveNext 
        Loop

End Function
