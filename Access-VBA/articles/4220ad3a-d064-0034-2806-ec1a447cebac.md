# OpenTable Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **OpenTable** action to open a table in Datasheet view, Design view, or Print Preview. You can also select a data entry mode for the table.


## Setting

The  **OpenTable** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Table Name**|The name of the table to open. The  **Table Name** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the Macro Builder pane shows all tables in the current database. This is a required argument. If you run a macro containing the **OpenTable** action in a library database, Microsoft Microsoft Access looks for the table with this name first in the library database, then in the current database.|
|**View**|The view in which the table will open. Click  **Datasheet**,  **Design**,  **Print Preview**,  **PivotTable**, or  **PivotChart** in the **View** box. The default is **Datasheet**.|
|**Data Mode**|The data entry mode for the table. This applies only to tables opened in Datasheet view. Click  **Add** (the user can add new records but can't edit existing records), **Edit** (the user can edit existing records and add new records), or **Read Only** (the user can only view records). The default is **Edit**.|

## Remarks

This action is similar to double-clicking the table in the Navigation Pane, or right-clicking the table in the Navigation Pane and selecting a view.


 **Tip**  You can drag a table from the Navigation Pane to a macro action row. This automatically creates an  **OpenTable** action that opens the table in Datasheet view.

To run the  **OpenTable** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **OpenTable** method of the **DoCmd** object.
