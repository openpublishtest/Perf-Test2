Any operation involving ADO objects can generate one or more provider errors. As each error occurs, one or more  **Error** objects are placed in the **Errors** collection of the **Connection** object. For details about handling warnings and errors in your ADO application, see[Chapter 6: Error Handling](6ae7343b-b9e0-c4c3-f65c-110f903e573e.md).

Application errors can be raised by a separate mechanism. For example, in Visual Basic, the  **Err** object will contain application-level errors.
