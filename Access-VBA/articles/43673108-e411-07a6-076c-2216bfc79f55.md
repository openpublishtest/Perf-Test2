# Cannot perform cascading operation. It would cause field <name> to become a zero-length string, which is not allowed. (Error 3402)

The cascade operation you are attempting would result in a zero-length string in the indicated field, which is set up to not allow zero-length strings. Check the values you are attempting to update and fix them so they do not result in zero-length strings in this field.
