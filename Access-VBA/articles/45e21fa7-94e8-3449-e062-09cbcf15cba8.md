# Determining Edit Mode

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

ADO maintains an editing buffer associated with the current record. The  **EditMode** property indicates whether changes have been made to this buffer or whether a new record has been created. Use **EditMode** to determine the editing status of the current record. You can test for pending changes if an editing process has been interrupted and determine whether you need to use the **Update** or **CancelUpdate** method.

 **EditMode** returns one of the **EditModeEnum** constants, which are listed in the following table.


|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**adEditNone**|Indicates that no editing operation is in progress.|
|**adEditInProgress**|Indicates that data in the current record has been modified but not saved.|
|**adEditAdd**|Indicates that the  **AddNew** method has been called, and the current record in the copy buffer is a new record that has not been saved to the database.|
|**adEditDelete**|Indicates that the current record has been deleted.|
 **EditMode** can return a valid value only if there is a current record. **EditMode** will return an error if **BOF** or **EOF** is **True** or if the current record has been deleted.
