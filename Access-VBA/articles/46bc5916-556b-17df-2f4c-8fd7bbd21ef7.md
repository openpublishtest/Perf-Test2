 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Deletes one or more existing  _user_ s or _group_ s, or removes one or more existing _user_ s from an existing _group_.


## Syntax

Delete one or more  _user_ s or remove one or more _user_ s from a _group_:

DROP USER  _user_ [, _user_, …] [FROM _group_ ]

Delete one or more  _group_ s:

DROP GROUP  _group_ [, _group_, …]

The DROP USER or GROUP statement has these parts:



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _user_|The name of a user to be removed from the workgroup information file.|
| _group_|The name of a group to be removed from the workgroup information file.|

## Remarks

If the FROM keyword is used in the DROP USER statement, then each of the  _user_ s listed in the statement will be removed from the _group_ specified following the FROM keyword. However, the _user_ s themselves will not be deleted.

The DROP GROUP statement will delete the specified  _group_ (s). The _user_ s who are members of the _group_ (s) will not be affected, but they will no longer be members of the deleted _group_ (s).
