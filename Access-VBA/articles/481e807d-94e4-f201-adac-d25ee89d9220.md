# TRANSACTION Statement (Microsoft Access SQL)

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Used to initiate and conclude explicit transactions.


## Syntax

Initiate a new transaction.

BEGIN TRANSACTION

Conclude a transaction by committing all work performed during the transaction.

COMMIT [TRANSACTION | WORK]

Conclude a transaction by rolling back all work performed during the transaction.

ROLLBACK [TRANSACTION | WORK]


## Remarks

Transactions are not started automatically. To start a transaction, you must do so explicitly using BEGIN TRANSACTION.

Transactions can be nested up to five levels deep. To start a nested transaction, use BEGIN TRANSACTION within the context of an existing transaction.

Transactions are not supported for linked tables.
