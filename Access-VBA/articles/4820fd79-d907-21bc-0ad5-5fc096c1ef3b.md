## Example

The following example compacts and repairs a database, creates a log if there's any corruption in the source file, and returns a  **Boolean** value based on whether the recovery was successful. For the example to work, you must pass it the paths and file names of the source and destination files.


```
Function RepairDatabase(strSource As String, _ 
        strDestination As String) As Boolean 
        ' Input values: the paths and file names of 
        ' the source and destination files. 
 
    ' Trap for errors. 
    On Error GoTo error_handler 
 
    ' Compact and repair the database. Use the return value of 
    ' the CompactRepair method to determine if the file was 
    ' successfully compacted. 
    RepairDatabase = _ 
        Application.CompactRepair( _ 
        LogFile:=True, _ 
        SourceFile:=strSource, _ 
        DestinationFile:=strDestination) 
 
    ' Reset the error trap and exit the function. 
    On Error GoTo 0 
    Exit Function 
 
' Return False if an error occurs. 
error_handler: 
    RepairDatabase = False 
 
End Function 

```
