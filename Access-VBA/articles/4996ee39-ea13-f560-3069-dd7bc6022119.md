# Containers Collection (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **Containers** collection contains all of the **Container** objects that are defined in a database.


## Remarks

Each  **Database** object has a **Containers** collection consisting of built-in **Container** objects. Some of these **Container** objects are defined by the Microsoft Access database engine while others may be defined by other applications.


## Example

This example enumerates the  **Containers** collection of the Northwind database and the **Properties** collection of each **Container** object in the collection.


```
Sub ContainerObjectX()

   Dim dbsNorthwind As Database
   Dim ctrLoop As Container
   Dim prpLoop As Property

   Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")

   With dbsNorthwind

      ' Enumerate Containers collection.
      For Each ctrLoop In .Containers
         Debug.Print "Properties of " &amp; ctrLoop.Name _
            &amp; " container"

         ' Enumerate Properties collection of each
         ' Container object.
         For Each prpLoop In ctrLoop.Properties
            Debug.Print "  " &amp; prpLoop.Name _
               &amp; " = " prpLoop
         Next prpLoop

      Next ctrLoop

      .Close
   End With

End Sub

```
