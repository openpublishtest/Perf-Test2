 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **WorkflowTasks** action to display the **Workflow Task** dialog box.


## Setting

The  **WorkflowTasks** action has the following argument.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Record Number**|The position of the item in the Microsoft SharePoint Foundation list, starting with  **1** for the first item in the list, **2** for the second item, and so on. You can also enter an expression for this argument.|

## Remarks


- The  **WorkflowTasks** action opens the **Workflow Tasks** dialog box. This dialog box displays all tasks that are available for the specified item. A workflow must be defined for the list in SharePoint Foundation.
    
- The  **WorkflowTasks** action can only be used after a linked SharePoint Foundation list has been opened and selected. To open and select the linked list, use the **OpenTable** action. If the list is already open, use the **SelectObject** action to select it.
    
- The  **WorkflowTasks** action has the same effect as right-clicking any cell in a linked SharePoint Foundation list while it is open in datasheet view, pointing to **Workflow**, and then clicking  **Workflow Tasks**.
    
- To run the  **WorkflowTasks** action in a VBA module, use the **WorkflowTasks** method of the **DoCmd** object.
