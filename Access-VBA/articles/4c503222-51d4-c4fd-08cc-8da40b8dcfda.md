# Cannot append an Index that is already a part of an Indexes collection. (Error 3269)

An  **Index** object was specified as an argument to an **Append** operation when it already is a member of an existing **Indexes** collection. Use the **Dim** statement and **CreateIndex** method to declare a new **Index** object and specify its values, and retry the operation with the new **Index** object.
