The  **Stuff** function contains the following arguments.

|:-----|:-----|
| _IntoTextExpression_|A text expression that specifies the text into which the text specified by the  _ThisTextExpression_ will be inserted.|
| _Start_|An integer value that specifies the location to start deletion and insertion. If start or length is negative, a null string is returned. If start is longer than the first  _IntoTextExpression_, a null string is returned.|
| _Length_|An integer that specifies the number of characters to delete. If length is longer than the first  _IntoTextExpression_, deletion occurs up to the last character in the last _IntoTextExpression_.|

If the  _Start_ or _Length_ arguments are negative, or if the starting position is larger than length of the first string, a null string is returned. If the start position is 0, a null value is returned. If the length to delete is longer than the first string, it is deleted to the first character in the first string.
