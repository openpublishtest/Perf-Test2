# RestoreWindow Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **RestoreWindow** action to restore a maximized or minimized window to its previous size.


 **Note**  This action can't be applied to code windows in the Visual Basic Editor. For information about how to affect code windows, see the  **WindowState** property topic.


## Setting

The  **RestoreWindow** action doesn't have any arguments.


## Remarks

This action works on the selected object. If an object has been minimized, you can first select it by using the  **SelectObject** action and then restore it to its previous size by using the **RestoreWindow** action.

You can use the  **MoveAndSizeWindow** action to move or size a window that you have restored.

The  **RestoreWindow** action has the same effect as clicking the **Restore** button in the window's upper-right corner or clicking the **Restore** command on the window's **Control** menu.

To run the  **RestoreWindow** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **Restore** method of the **DoCmd** object.
