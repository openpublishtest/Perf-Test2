Specifies the location of the cursor service.


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**adUseClient**|3|Uses client-side cursors supplied by a local cursor library. Local cursor services often will allow many features that driver-supplied cursors may not, so using this setting may provide an advantage with respect to features that will be enabled. For backward compatibility, the synonym  **adUseClientBatch** is also supported.|
|**adUseNone**|1|Does not use cursor services. (This constant is obsolete and appears solely for the sake of backward compatibility.)|
|**adUseServer**|2|Default. Uses data-provider or driver-supplied cursors. These cursors are sometimes very flexible and allow for additional sensitivity to changes others make to the data source. However, some features of the [Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB](6818fc05-9c9f-9b67-07d2-e622c93133c2.md) (such as disassociated[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) objects) cannot be simulated with server-side cursors and these features will be unavailable with this setting.|
