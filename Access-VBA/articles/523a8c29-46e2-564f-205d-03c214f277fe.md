Sets or returns the sort order for records in a  **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Sort**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

You can use the  **Sort** property with dynaset- and snapshot-type **Recordset** objects.

When you set this property for an object, sorting occurs when a subsequent  **Recordset** object is created from that object. The **Sort** property setting overrides any sort order specified for a **[QueryDef](0b3d901c-345d-42a2-f5f1-fb09cc562e27.md)** object.

The default sort order is ascending (A to Z or 0 to 100).

The  **Sort** property doesn't apply to table- or forward-only-type **Recordset** objects. To sort a table-type **Recordset** object, use the **[Index](614bdf53-aca3-25ef-a23c-50095b345d20.md)** property.




 **Note**  In many cases, it's faster to open a new  **Recordset** object by using an SQL statement that includes the sorting criteria.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example demonstrates the  **Sort** property by changing its value and creating a new **Recordset**. The SortOutput function is required for this procedure to run.


```
Sub SortX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset2 
 Dim rstSortEmployees As Recordset2 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 
 With rstEmployees 
 SortOutput "Original Recordset:", rstEmployees 
 .Sort = "LastName, FirstName" 
 ' Print report showing Sort property and record order. 
 SortOutput _ 
 "Recordset after changing Sort property:", _ 
 rstEmployees 
 ' Open new Recordset from current one. 
 Set rstSortEmployees = .OpenRecordset 
 ' Print report showing Sort property and record order. 
 SortOutput "New Recordset:", rstSortEmployees 
 rstSortEmployees.Close 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Function SortOutput(strTemp As String, _ 
 rstTemp As Recordset) 
 
 With rstTemp 
 Debug.Print strTemp 
 Debug.Print " Sort = " &amp; _ 
 IIf(.Sort <> "", .Sort, "[Empty]") 
 .MoveFirst 
 
 ' Enumerate Recordset. 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 Debug.Print " " &amp; !LastName &amp; _ 
 ", " &amp; !FirstName 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 
 End With 
 
End Function 

```

When you know the data you want to select, it's usually more efficient to create a  **Recordset** with an SQL statement. This example shows how you can create just one **Recordset** and obtain the same results as in the preceding example.




```
Sub SortX2() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 ' Open a Recordset from an SQL statement that specifies a 
 ' sort order. 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("SELECT * " &amp; _ 
 "FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 

```
