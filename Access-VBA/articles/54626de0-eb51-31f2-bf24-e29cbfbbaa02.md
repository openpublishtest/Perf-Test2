Sets or returns a value that indicates the name of the current  **[Index](92c32cad-ec8a-1243-1d18-83f50b269ecb.md)** object in a table-type **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Index**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Records in base tables aren't stored in any particular order. Setting the  **Index** property changes the order of records returned from the database; it doesn't affect the order in which the records are stored.

The specified  **Index** object must already be defined. If you set the **Index** property to an **Index** object that doesn't exist or if the **Index** property isn't set when you use the **[Seek](ef83d909-c962-b016-7d33-36eacdc25c2c.md)** method, a trappable error occurs.

Examine the  **Indexes** collection of a **TableDef** object to determine what **Index** objects are available to table-type **Recordset** objects created from that **TableDef** object.

You can create a new index for the table by creating a new  **Index** object, setting its properties, appending it to the **Indexes** collection of the underlying **TableDef** object, and then reopening the **Recordset** object.

Records returned from a table-type  **Recordset** object can be ordered only by the indexes defined for the underlying **TableDef** object. To sort records in some other order, you can open a dynaset-, snapshot-, or forward-only-type **Recordset** object by using an SQL statement with an ORDER BY clause.


 **Note**  


## Example

This example uses the  **Index** property to set different record orders for a table-type **Recordset**.


```
Sub IndexPropertyX() 
 
   Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
   Dim tdfEmployees As TableDef 
   Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
   Dim idxLoop As Index 
 
   Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
   Set rstEmployees = _ 
      dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees") 
   Set tdfEmployees = dbsNorthwind.TableDefs!Employees 
 
   With rstEmployees 
 
      ' Enumerate Indexes collection of Employees table. 
      For Each idxLoop In tdfEmployees.Indexes 
         .Index = idxLoop.Name 
         Debug.Print "Index = " &amp; .Index 
         Debug.Print "  EmployeeID - PostalCode - Name" 
         .MoveFirst 
 
         ' Enumerate Recordset to show the order of records. 
         Do While Not .EOF 
            Debug.Print "    " &amp; !EmployeeID &amp; " - " &amp; _ 
               !PostalCode &amp; " - " &amp; !FirstName &amp; " " &amp; _ 
               !LastName 
            .MoveNext 
         Loop 
 
      Next idxLoop 
 
      .Close 
   End With 
 
   dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 

```

This example demonstrates the  **Seek** method by allowing the user to search for a product based on an ID number.




```
Sub SeekX() 
 
   Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
   Dim rstProducts As Recordset 
   Dim intFirst As Integer 
   Dim intLast As Integer 
   Dim strMessage As String 
   Dim strSeek As String 
   Dim varBookmark As Variant 
 
   Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
   ' You must open a table-type Recordset to use an index,  
   ' and hence the Seek method. 
   Set rstProducts = _ 
      dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Products", dbOpenTable) 
 
   With rstProducts 
      ' Set the index. 
      .Index = "PrimaryKey" 
 
      ' Get the lowest and highest product IDs. 
      .MoveLast 
      intLast = !ProductID 
      .MoveFirst 
      intFirst = !ProductID 
 
      Do While True 
         ' Display current record information and ask user  
         ' for ID number. 
         strMessage = "Product ID: " &amp; !ProductID &amp; vbCr &amp; _ 
            "Name: " &amp; !ProductName &amp; vbCr &amp; vbCr &amp; _ 
            "Enter a product ID between " &amp; intFirst &amp; _ 
            " and " &amp; intLast &amp; "." 
         strSeek = InputBox(strMessage) 
 
         If strSeek = "" Then Exit Do 
 
         ' Store current bookmark in case the Seek fails. 
         varBookmark = .Bookmark 
 
         .Seek "=", Val(strSeek) 
 
         ' Return to the current record if the Seek fails. 
         If .NoMatch Then 
            MsgBox "ID not found!" 
            .Bookmark = varBookmark 
         End If 
      Loop 
 
      .Close 
   End With 
 
   dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 

```

The following example shows how to use the  **Seek** method to find a record in a linked table.

    dbs.Close
    dbsExt.Close

    Set tdf = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
