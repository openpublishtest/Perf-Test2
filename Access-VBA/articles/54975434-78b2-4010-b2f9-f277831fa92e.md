Use the  **SetField** action to specify the new values of a field in the edited record.

You can use an  **If...Then...Else** statement to perform operations based on a condition.

To cancel the editing of a record, use the  **CancelRecordChange** action. This prevents the changes from being committed and exits the **EditRecord** data block.

You can use the  **LastCreateRecordIdentity** local variable to work with last record created in a **CreateRecord** data block. For example, use the following syntax to refer to the AssignedTo field of the most recently created record:




```
[LastCreateRecordIdentity].[AssignedTo]
```
