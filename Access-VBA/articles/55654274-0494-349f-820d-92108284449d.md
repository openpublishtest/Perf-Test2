Hybrid commands are partially parameterized commands. For example:




```
 
SHAPE {select * from plants} 
 APPEND( {select * from customers where country = ?} 
 RELATE PlantCountry TO PARAMETER 0, 
 PlantRegion TO CustomerRegion ) 

```

The caching behavior for a hybrid command is the same as that of regular parameterized commands.
