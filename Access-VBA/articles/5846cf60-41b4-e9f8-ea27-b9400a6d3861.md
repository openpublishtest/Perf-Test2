# AllReports Object (Access)

The  **AllReports** collection contains an **[AccessObject](8a770b33-5bff-120a-6707-ca214ee5ced3.md)** for each report in the **[CurrentProject](e6baae73-1eeb-b48f-d35e-b3e921378561.md)** or **[CodeProject](70b71f57-df23-2cf7-23f5-147053a8ec26.md)** object.


## Remarks

The  **CurrentProject** or **CodeProject** object has an **AllReports** collection containing **AccessObject** objects that describe instances of all the reports in the database. For example, you can enumerate the **AllReports** collection in Visual Basic to set or return the values of properties of individual **AccessObject** objects in the collection.

You can refer to an individual  **AccessObject** object in the **AllReports** collection either by referring to the item by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If you want to refer to a specific report in the **AllReports** collection, it's better to refer to the item by name because the index may change.

The  **AllReports** collection is indexed beginning with zero. If you refer to a report by its index, the first report is AllReports(0), the second report is AllReports(1), and so on.


 **Note**  To list all open reports in the database, use the  **[IsLoaded](5e68398c-8a95-f3e1-87ec-e2d637f34429.md)** property of each **AccessObject** object in the **AllReports** collection. You can then use the **Name** property of each individual **AccessObject** object to return the name of a report.

You can't add or delete an  **AccessObject** object from the **AllReports** collection.


## Example

The following example prints the name of each open  **AccessObject** object in the **AllReports** collection.


```
Sub AllReports() 
 Dim obj As AccessObject, dbs As Object 
 Set dbs = Application.CurrentProject 
 ' Search for open AccessObject objects in AllReports collection. 
 For Each obj In dbs.AllReports 
 If obj.IsLoaded = True Then 
 ' Print name of obj. 
 Debug.Print obj.Name 
 End If 
 Next obj 
End Sub
```
