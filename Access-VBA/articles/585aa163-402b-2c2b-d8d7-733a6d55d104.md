A  **Field2** object represents a column of data with a common data type and a common set of properties.

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

A  **Field2** object is contains all of the same properties and methods as the **[Field](47282ce2-9b49-ccf9-ad37-c4bb25cfd037.md)** object. The **Field2** object contains several new properties and methods that support multi-valued field types. The new properties and methods are:


-  **[AppendOnly](4427f3af-6393-0f1c-ecac-017112022583.md)** property
    
-  **[ComplexType](9b4ebabf-22de-0ab8-73ea-10c496eedf97.md)** property
    
-  **[IsComplex](ffc90e6e-e3ee-4f9b-ca6b-615199300d45.md)** property
    
-  **[LoadFromFile](8ffe4636-d4da-0579-f4b5-14f423647562.md)** method
    
-  **[SaveToFile](250f9596-1a03-471d-96f9-718cd57dc94f.md)** method
    
To refer to a  **Field2** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:

 **Fields** (0)

 **Fields** (" _name_")

 **Fields** ![ _name_]

With the same syntax forms, you can also refer to the  **Value** property of a **Field2** object that you create and append to a **Fields** collection. The context of the field reference will determine whether you are referring to the **Field2** object or the **Value** property of the **Field** object.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The following example shows how to navigate a  **Recordset** that contains a multi-value field.

The following example shows how to navigate the files in an attachment field. The file type and filename of each attachment is printed in the Immediate window.




```
Sub ListAttachments()
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld As DAO.Field2
    
    'Get the database, recordset, and attachment field
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the table
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Print the first and last name
        Debug.Print rst("FirstName") &amp; " " &amp; rst("LastName")
        
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Print all attachments in the field
        Do While Not rsA.EOF
            Debug.Print , rsA("FileType"), rsA("FileName")
            
            'Next attachment
            rsA.MoveNext
        Loop
        
        rsA.Close
        
        'Next record
        rst.MoveNext
    Loop
    
        
    rst.Close
    dbs.Close
    
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set rsA = Nothing
    Set rst = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to add files from a specified folder path to an attachment field.




```
Public Function LoadAttachments(strPath As String, Optional strPattern As String = "*.*") As Long
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld  As DAO.Field2
    Dim strFile As String
    
    'Get the database, recordset, and attachment field
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the table
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Load all attachments in the specified directory
        strFile = Dir(strPath &amp; "\*.*")
        
        rst.Edit
        Do While Len(strFile) > 0
            'Add a new attachment that matches the pattern.
            'Pass "" to match all files.
            If strFile Like strPattern Then
                rsA.AddNew
                rsA("FileData").LoadFromFile strPath &amp; "\" &amp; strFile
                rsA.Update
                
                'Increment the number of files added
                LoadAttachments = LoadAttachments + 1
            End If
            strFile = Dir
        Loop
        rsA.Close
        
        rst.Update
        'Next record
        rst.MoveNext
    Loop
    
    rst.Close
    dbs.Close
    
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set rsA = Nothing
    Set rst = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Function
```

The following example shows how to save the files stored in an attachment field to the specified folder path.




```
Public Function SaveAttachments(strPath As String, Optional strPattern As String = "*.*") As Long
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld As DAO.Field2
    Dim strFullPath As String
    
    'Get the database, recordset, and attachment field
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the table
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Save all attachments in the field
        Do While Not rsA.EOF
            If rsA("FileName") Like strPattern Then
                strFullPath = strPath &amp; "\" &amp; rsA("FileName")
                
                'Make sure the file does not exist and save
                If Dir(strFullPath) = "" Then
                    rsA("FileData").SaveToFile strFullPath
                End If
                
                'Increment the number of files saved
                SaveAttachments = SaveAttachments + 1
            End If
            
            'Next attachment
            rsA.MoveNext
        Loop
        rsA.Close
        
        'Next record

    Loop
    
    rst.Close
    dbs.Close
    
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set rsA = Nothing
    Set rst = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing

The following example shows how to delete a file stored in an attachment field.




```
Function RemoveAttachment(strRemoveFile As String, Optional strFilter As String) As Long
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld As DAO.Field2
    
    'Get the database
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    
    'Open the recordset. If the strFilter is supplied, add it to the WHERE
    'clause for the recordset. Otherwise, any files matching strFileName
    'will be deleted
    If Len(strFilter) > 0 Then
        Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM tblAttachments WHERE " &amp; strFilter)
    Else
        Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    End If
    
    'Get the Attachment field
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the recordset
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Walk the attachments and look for the file name to remove
        Do While Not rsA.EOF
            If rsA("FileName") Like strRemoveFile Then
                rsA.Delete
                
                'Increment the number of files removed
                RemoveAttachment = RemoveAttachment + 1
            End If
            rsA.MoveNext
        Loop
                
        'Cleanup the Attachments recordset
        rsA.Close
        Set rsA = Nothing
        
        'Next record
        rst.MoveNext
    Loop
    
    rst.Close
    dbs.Close
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set rst = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
