# Compact and Repair a Database

## Overview

Access database files (.accdb) can grow quickly as you use them, sometimes impeding performance. They can also occasionally become corrupted or damaged. You can use the  **CompactRepair** method on the **Access.Application** object to prevent or fix these problems.

The  **CompactRepair** method compacts a bloated database file, and if the database file is corrupted, repairs the database file and creates a log file. This method returns a **Boolean** value based on whether the recovery was successful (True for success).


## Example


```

' Example driver application.
Sub Test()

Dim repaired As Boolean

' You can simply make up a name for the destination file.
repaired = RepairDatabase("C:\Users\Public\Documents\Database.accdb", _
                              "C:\Users\Public\Documents\DatabaseRepaired.accdb")

MsgBox repaired

End Sub

' Input values: The fully-qualified path names of the source and destination
' database files.
Function RepairDatabase(sourceDb As String, destDb As String) As Boolean

' Compact and repair the database. You can use the return value of the
' CompactRepair method to determine if the file was successfully compacted.
RepairDatabase = Access.Application.CompactRepair(sourceDb, destDb, True)

End Function

```
