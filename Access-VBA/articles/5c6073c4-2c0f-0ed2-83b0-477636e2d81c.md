You can use the  **OnError** action to specify what should happen when an error occurs in a macro.

## Setting
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  **OnError** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _Go to_|Specify the general behavior that should occur when an error is encountered. Click the drop-down arrow and then click one of the following settings:

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Next**|Microsoft Office Access 2007 records the details of the error in the  **MacroError** object but does not stop the macro. The macro continues with the next action.|
|**Macro Name**|Access stops the current macro and runs the macro that is named in the  **Macro Name** argument.|
|**Fail**|Access stops the current macro and displays an error message.|
|
| _Macro Name_|If the  _Go to_ argument is set to _Macro Name_, type the name of the macro to be used for error handling. The name you type must match a name in the  **Macro Name** column of the current macro; you can't enter the name of a different macro object. In the example below, the **ErrorHandler** macro is contained in the same macro object as the **OnError** action. This argument must be left blank if the _Go to_ argument is set to **Next** or **Fail**.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>


- The  **OnError** action is usually placed at the beginning of a macro, but you can also place the action later in the macro. The rules established by the action will take effect whenever the action is run.
    
- If you set the  _Go to_ argument to **Fail**, Access behaves the same way it would if there were no **OnError** action in the macro. That is, if an error is encountered, Access stops the macro and displays a standard error message. The main use for the **Fail** setting is to turn off any error handling that you established earlier in a macro.
    

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following macro demonstrates the use of the  **OnError** action. In this example, the **OnError** action specifies that Access run a custom error handling macro named **ErrorHandler** when an error occurs. When an error occurs, the **CatchErrors** submacro is called. If the error number is 2102, a specific message is displayed and macro execution is halted. Otherwise, a message describing the error is displayed and the macro is paused so that you can perform additional troubleshooting. The **ErrorHandler** macro displays a message box that refers to the **MacroError** object to display information about the error.
