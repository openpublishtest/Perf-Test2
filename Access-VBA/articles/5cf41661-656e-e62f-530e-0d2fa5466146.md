You can use the  **ActiveForm** property together with the **[Screen](00743775-071b-9ccd-7687-f3b992e9346e.md)** object to identify or refer to the form that has the focus. Read-only **Form** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Screen** object.


## Remarks

This property setting contains a reference to the  **[Form](72ef9219-142b-b690-b696-3eba9a5d4522.md)** object that has the focus at run time.

You can use the  **ActiveForm** property to refer to an active form together with one of its properties or methods. The following example displays the **Name** property setting of the active form.




```
Dim frmCurrentForm As Form 
Set frmCurrentForm = Screen.ActiveForm
