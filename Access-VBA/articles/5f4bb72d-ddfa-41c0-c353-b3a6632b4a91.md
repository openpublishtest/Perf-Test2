## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 _DataControl_. **SourceRecordset** = _Recordset_

 _Recordset_ = _DataControl_. **Recordset**


## Parameters
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>


-  _DataControl_
    
- An object variable that represents an [RDS.DataControl](ac430669-7628-696c-c036-b5d35405d788.md) object.
    
-  _Recordset_
    
- An object variable that represents a  **Recordset** object.
    

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

You can set the  **SourceRecordset** property to a[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) returned from a custom business object.

These properties allow an application to handle the binding process by means of a custom process. They receive a rowset wrapped in a  **Recordset** so that you can interact directly with the **Recordset**, performing actions such as setting properties or iterating through the **Recordset**.

You can set the  **SourceRecordset** property or read the **Recordset** property at run time in scripting code.

 **SourceRecordset** is a write-only property, in contrast to the **Recordset** property, which is a read-only property.
