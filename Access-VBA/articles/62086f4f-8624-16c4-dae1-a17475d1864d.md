# Mode Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the available permissions for modifying data in a [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md), [Record](817aaf13-78d4-1134-aa94-997e92077c22.md), or [Stream](d49b1514-e0b4-0aca-d5c2-8266f3f4fe65.md) object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a [ConnectModeEnum](a15aa733-f899-5fe9-e705-67a4301706d1.md) value. The default value for a **Connection** is **adModeUnknown**. The default value for a **Record** object is **adModeRead**. The default value for a **Stream** associated with an underlying source (opened with a URL as the source, or as the default **Stream** of a **Record** ) is **adModeRead**. The default value for a **Stream** not associated with an underlying source (instantiated in memory) is **adModeUnknown**.


## Remarks

Use the  **Mode** property to set or return the access permissions in use by the provider on the current connection. You can set the **Mode** property only when the **Connection** object is closed.

For a  **Stream** object, if the access mode is not specified, it is inherited from the source used to open the **Stream** object. For example, if a **Stream** is opened from a **Record** object, by default it is opened in the same mode as the **Record**.

This property is read/write while the object is closed and read-only while the object is open.

 **Remote Data Service Usage** When used on a client-side Connection object, the **Mode** property can only be set to **adModeUnknown**.
