# Connections Collection (DAO)

 **Last modified:** March 16, 2012

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

 **Note**  ODBCDirect workspaces are not supported in Microsoft Access 2013. Use ADO if you want to access external data sources without using the Microsoft Access database engine.

A  **Connections** collection contains the current **Connection** objects of a **Workspace** object. (ODBCDirect workspaces only).

## Remarks

When you open a  **Connection** object, it is automatically appended to the **Connections** collection of the **Workspace**. When you close a **Connection** object with the **[Close](9b1a77cb-da12-24d6-892f-a56be103d51d.md)** method, it is removed from the **Connections** collection. You should close all open **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** objects within the **Connection** before closing it.

At the same time you open a  **Connection** object, a corresponding **[Database](6cf2ddf8-3957-a15e-5eeb-85f81c1e415e.md)** object is created and appended to the **[Databases](988ae6f5-ec15-cd1c-191d-f295624425f4.md)** collection in the same **Workspace**, and vice versa. Similarly, when you close the **Connection**, the corresponding **Database** is deleted from the **Databases** collection, and so on.

The  **Name** property setting of a **Connection** is a string that specifies the path of the database file. To refer to a **Connection** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:


-  **Connections** (0)
    
-  **Connections** (" _name_ ")
    
-  **Connections** ![ _name_ ]
    





 **Note**  You can open the same data source more than once, creating duplicate names in the  **Connections** collection. You should assign **Connection** objects to object variables and refer to them by variable name.


## Example

This example demonstrates the  **Connection** object and **Connections** collection by opening a **Database** object and two ODBCDirect **Connection** objects and listing the properties available to each object.


```
Sub ConnectionObjectX() 
 
   Dim wrkAcc as Workspace 
   Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
   Dim wrkODBC As Workspace 
   Dim conPubs As Connection 
   Dim conPubs2 As Connection 
   Dim conLoop As Connection 
   Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
   ' Open a Database object. 
   Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("NewWorkspace", _ 
      "admin", "", dbUseJet) 
   Set dbsNorthwind = wrkAcc.OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
   ' Create ODBCDirect Workspace object and open Connection 
   ' objects. 
   Set wrkODBC = CreateWorkspace("NewODBCWorkspace", _ 
      "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
       
   ' Note: The DSNs referenced below must be configured to  
   '       use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to  
   '       authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
   Set conPubs = wrkODBC.OpenConnection("Connection1", , , _ 
      "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
       
   Set conPubs2 = wrkODBC.OpenConnection("Connection2", , _ 
      True, "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
 
   Debug.Print "Database properties:" 
 
   With dbsNorthwind 
      ' Enumerate Properties collection of Database object. 
      For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
         On Error Resume Next 
         Debug.Print "  " &amp; prpLoop.Name &amp; " = " &amp; _ 
            prpLoop.Value 
         On Error GoTo 0 
      Next prpLoop 
   End With 
 
   ' Enumerate the Connections collection. 
   For Each conLoop In wrkODBC.Connections 
      Debug.Print "Connection properties for " &amp; _ 
         conLoop.Name &amp; ":" 
 
      With conLoop 
         ' Print property values by explicitly calling each 
         ' Property object; the Connection object does not 
         ' support a Properties collection. 
         Debug.Print "  Connect = " &amp; .Connect 
         ' Property actually returns a Database object. 
         Debug.Print "  Database[.Name] = " &amp; _ 
            .Database.Name 
         Debug.Print "  Name = " &amp; .Name 
         Debug.Print "  QueryTimeout = " &amp; .QueryTimeout 
         Debug.Print "  RecordsAffected = " &amp; _ 
            .RecordsAffected 
         Debug.Print "  StillExecuting = " &amp; _ 
            .StillExecuting 
         Debug.Print "  Transactions = " &amp; .Transactions 
         Debug.Print "  Updatable = " &amp; .Updatable 
      End With 
 
   Next conLoop 
 
   dbsNorthwind.Close 
   conPubs.Close 
   conPubs2.Close 
   wrkAcc.Close 
   wrkODBC.Close 
 
End Sub 
 

```

This example uses the  **OpenConnection** method with different parameters to open three different **Connection** objects.

      End With 
 
   Next conLoop

End Sub
