# Index (Definition)

An index is a Microsoft Access feature that speeds up searching and sorting in a table. You can create an index for a field in the Indexes window of table Design view, or by setting the field's  **Indexed** property to Yes.


 **Note**  The primary key of a table is automatically indexed, and fields for which the data type is Memo or OLE Object can't be indexed.
