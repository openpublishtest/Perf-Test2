# Cannot populate the replica or change the replica's filter because the replica has conflicts or data errors. (Error 3636)

You are attempting to change a partial replica's filter or populate a partial replica, and that replica has conflicts or data errors. You need to resolve the conflicts or errors before proceeding. This prevents inadvertent loss of conflict information and ensures that errors are corrected properly.
