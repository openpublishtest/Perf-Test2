# Field.OriginalValue Property (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_





## Syntax

 _expression_. **OriginalValue**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Field** object.


## Remarks

During an optimistic batch update, a collision may occur where a second client modifies the same field and record in between the time the first client retrieves the data and the first client's update attempt. The  **OriginalValue** property contains the value of the field at the time the last batch **Update** began. If this value does not match the value actually in the database when the batch **Update** attempts to write to the database, a collision occurs. When this happens, the new value in the database will be accessible through the **[VisibleValue](e40fcb43-9a1d-69e7-1544-8f15ef21daf4.md)** property.
