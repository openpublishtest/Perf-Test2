# Set Startup Properties and Options in Code

Startup properties affect how your database application appears when it's opened. For example, startup properties enable you to customize the application's title bar, menus, toolbars, and startup form. The startup properties are available in the Current Database category of the  **Access Options** dialog box. To view the **Access Options** dialog box, click the **Microsoft Office Button** and then click **Access Options**.

You can set options in the  **Access Options** dialog box to change various aspects of the application's environment while you're working in it. For example, you can set form, report, table, and query default options.
