# Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB (ADO Service Provider)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

The Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB service provider supports the construction of hierarchical (shaped) [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) objects from a data provider.


## Provider Keyword

To invoke the Data Shaping Service for OLE DB, specify the following keyword and value in the connection string.


```
 
"Provider=MSDataShape" 

```


## Dynamic Properties

When this service provider is invoked, the following dynamic properties are added to the [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) object's[Properties](4d662790-1252-c930-e6f9-edf6a38636af.md) collection.



|**Dynamic Property Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Unique Reshape Names**|Indicates whether  **Recordset** objects with duplicate values for their **Reshape Name** properties are allowed. If this dynamic property is **True** and a new **Recordset** is created with the same user-specified reshape name as an existing **Recordset**, then the new **Recordset** object's reshape name is modified to make it unique. If this property is **False** and a new **Recordset** is created with the same user-specified reshape name as the existing **Recordset**, both **Recordset** objects will have the same reshape name. Therefore, neither **Recordset** can be reshaped as long as both recordsets exist. The default value of the property is **False**.|
|**Data Provider**|Indicates the name of the provider that will supply rows to be shaped. This value may be NONE if a provider will not be used to supply rows.|
You may also set writable dynamic properties by specifying their names as keywords in the connection string. For example, in Microsoft Visual Basic, set the  **Data Provider** dynamic property to "MSDASQL" by specifying:




```
 
Dim cn as New ADODB.Connection 
cn.Open "Provider=MSDataShape;Data Provider=MSDASQL" 

```

You may also set or retrieve a dynamic property by specifying its name as the index to the [Properties](4d662790-1252-c930-e6f9-edf6a38636af.md) property. For example, get and print the current value of the **Data Provider** dynamic property, then set a new value, like this:




```
 
Debug.Print cn.Properties("Data Provider") 
cn.Properties("Data Provider") = "MSDASQL" 

```
