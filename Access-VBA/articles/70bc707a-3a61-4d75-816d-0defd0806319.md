## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_ = _expression_

 _expression_ Is any valid expression. If the expressions are not of the same data type, the data type for one expression must be implicitly convertible to the data type of the other. The conversion depends on the rules of data type precedence.


## Return Type
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 **Boolean**


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

When you compare two NULL expressions, the result is TRUE.

Comparing NULL to a non-NULL value always results in FALSE.
