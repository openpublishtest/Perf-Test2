# Form Object (Access)

A  **Form** object refers to a particular Microsoft Access form.


## Remarks

A  **Form** object is a member of the **Forms** collection, which is a collection of all currently open forms. Within the **Forms** collection, individual forms are indexed beginning with zero. You can refer to an individual **Form** object in the **Forms** collection either by referring to the form by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If you want to refer to a specific form in the **Forms** collection, it's better to refer to the form by name because a form's collection index may change. If the form name includes a space, the name must be surrounded by brackets ([ ]).



|**Syntax**|**Example**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**AllForms** ! _formname_|AllForms!OrderForm|
|**AllForms** ![ _form name_]|AllForms![Order Form]|
|**AllForms** (" _formname_")|AllForms("OrderForm")|
|**AllForms** ( _formname_)|AllForms(0)|
Each  **Form** object has a **Controls** collection, which contains all controls on the form. You can refer to a control on a form either by implicitly or explicitly referring to the **Controls** collection. Your code will be faster if you refer to the **Controls** collection implicitly. The following examples show two of the ways you might refer to a control named **NewData** on the form called **OrderForm**:




```
' Implicit reference. 
Forms!OrderForm!NewData
```




```
' Explicit reference. 
Forms!OrderForm.Controls!NewData
```

The next two examples show how you might refer to a control named  **NewData** on a subform `ctlSubForm` contained in the form called **OrderForm**:




```
Forms!OrderForm.ctlSubForm.Form!Controls.NewData
```




```
Forms!OrderForm.ctlSubForm!NewData
```

## Example

The following example shows how to use  **TextBox** controls to supply date criteria for a query.

```
Private Sub cmdSearch_Click()

   Dim db As DAO.Database
   Dim qd As QueryDef
   Dim vWhere As Variant

   Set db = CurrentDb()

   On Error Resume Next
   db.QueryDefs.Delete "Query1"
   On Error GoTo 0

   vWhere = Null

   vWhere = vWhere &amp; " AND [PayeeID]=" + Me.cboPayeeID

   If Nz(Me.txtEndDate, "") <> "" And Nz(Me.txtStartDate, "") <> "" Then
      vWhere = vWhere &amp; " AND [RefundProcessed] Between #" &amp; _
      Me.txtStartDate &amp; "# AND #" &amp; Me.txtEndDate &amp; "#"
   Else
      If Nz(Me.txtEndDate, "") = "" And Nz(Me.txtStartDate, "") <> "" Then
         vWhere = vWhere &amp; " AND [RefundProcessed]>=#" _
                  + Me.txtStartDate &amp; "#"
      Else
         If Nz(Me.txtEndDate, "") <> "" And Nz(Me.txtStartDate, "") = "" Then
            vWhere = vWhere &amp; " AND [RefundProcessed] <=#" _
                     + Me.txtEndDate &amp; "#"
      End If
     End If
   End If

   If Nz(vWhere, "") = "" Then
      MsgBox "There are no search criteria selected." &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
             "Search Cancelled.", vbInformation, "Search Canceled."
   Else
      Set qd = db.CreateQueryDef("Query1", "SELECT * FROM tblRefundData? &amp; _
               " WHERE " &amp; Mid(vWhere, 6))
      db.Close
      Set db = Nothing

      DoCmd.OpenQuery "Query1", acViewNormal, acReadOnly
   End If
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to use the  **BeforeUpdate** event of a form to require that a value be entered into one control when another control also has data.

 **Sample code provided by:** The[Microsoft Access 2010 Programmer?s Reference](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Access-2010-Programmer-s-Reference.productCd-0470591668.mdl)




```
Private Sub Form_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)
If (IsNull(Me.FieldOne)) Or (Me.FieldOne.Value =  "") Then
    ' No action required
Else
    If (IsNull(Me.FieldTwo)) or (Me.FieldTwo.Value = "") Then
        MsgBox "You must provide data for field 'FieldTwo', " &amp; _
            "if a value is entered in FieldOne", _
            vbOKOnly, "Required Field"
        Me.FieldTwo.SetFocus
        Cancel = True
        Exit Sub
    End If
End If

End Sub
```

The following example shows how to use the  **OpenArgs** property to prevent a form from being opened from the Navigation Pane.




```
Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)

If Me.OpenArgs() <> "Valid User" Then
    MsgBox "You are not authorized to use this form!", _
        vbExclamation + vbOKOnly, "Invalid Access"
    Cancel = True
End If
End Sub
```

The following example shows how to use the  _WhereCondition_ argument of the **OpenForm** method to filter the records displayed on a form as it is opened.




```
Private Sub cmdShowOrders_Click()
If Not Me.NewRecord Then
    DoCmd.OpenForm "frmOrder", _
        WhereCondition:="CustomerID=" &amp; Me.txtCustomerID
End If
End Sub
```
