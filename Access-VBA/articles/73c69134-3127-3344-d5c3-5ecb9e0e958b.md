Chapter 2 explained how to retrieve data from a data source as a  **Recordset** object. This chapter will discuss the **Recordset** in more detail, including how to navigate through the **Recordset** and view its data.

 **Recordsets** have methods and properties designed to make it easy to move through them and examine their contents. Depending on the functionality supported by the provider, some **Recordset** methods or properties might not be available. To continue exploring the **Recordset** object, consider a **Recordset** that would be returned from the Northwind sample database on Microsoft SQL Server 2000, using the following code:



```
 
'BeginRsTour 
Public Sub RecordsetTour() 
 On Error GoTo ErrHandler: 
 
 Dim objRs As New ADODB.Recordset 
 Dim strSQL As String 
 
 strSQL = "SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UnitPrice FROM Products " &amp; _ 
 "WHERE CategoryID = 7" '7 = Produce 
 
 objRs.Open strSQL, strConnStr, adOpenForwardOnly, _ 
 adLockReadOnly, adCmdText 
 
 'Clean up 
 objRs.Close 
 Set objRs = Nothing 
 Exit Sub 
 
ErrHandler: 
 If Not objRs Is Nothing Then 
 If objRs.State = adStateOpen Then objRs.Close 
 Set objRs = Nothing 
 End If 
 
 If Err <> 0 Then 
 MsgBox Err.Source &amp; "-->" &amp; Err.Description, , "Error" 
 End If 
End Sub 
'EndRsTour 

```

This SQL query returns a  **Recordset** with five rows (records) and three columns (fields). The values for each row are shown in the following table.


|**FIELD 0
Name = ProductID**|**FIELD 1
Name = ProductName**|**FIELD 2
Name = UnitPrice**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|7|Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears|30.0000|
|14|Tofu|23.2500|
|28|Rssle Sauerkraut|45.6000|
|51|Manjimup Dried Apples|53.0000|
|74|Longlife Tofu|10.0000|
The next section will explain how to locate the current position of the cursor in this sample  **Recordset**.
