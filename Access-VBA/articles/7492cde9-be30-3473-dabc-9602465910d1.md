[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Sets or returns the maximum number of records to return from a query against an ODBC data source.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **MaxRecords**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **QueryDef** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The default value is 0, indicating no limit on the number of records returned.

Once the number of rows specified by  **MaxRecords** is returned to your application in a **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)**, the query processor will stop returning additional records even if more records would qualify for inclusion in the **Recordset**. This property is useful in situations where limited client resources prohibit management of large numbers of records.




 **Note**  The  **MaxRecords** property can only be used with an ODBC data source.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **MaxRecords** property to set a limit on how many records are returned by a query on an ODBC data source.


```
Sub MaxRecordsX() 
 
 Dim dbsCurrent As Database 
 Dim qdfPassThrough As QueryDef 
 Dim qdfLocal As QueryDef 
 Dim rstTemp As Recordset 
 
 ' Open a database from which QueryDef objects can be 
 ' created. 
 Set dbsCurrent = OpenDatabase("DB1.mdb") 
 
 ' Create a pass-through query to retrieve data from 
 ' a Microsoft SQL Server database. 
 Set qdfPassThrough = _ 
 dbsCurrent.CreateQueryDef("") 
 
 ' Set the properties of the new query, limiting the 
 ' number of returnable records to 20. 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 qdfPassThrough.Connect = _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers" 
 qdfPassThrough.SQL = "SELECT * FROM titles" 
 qdfPassThrough.ReturnsRecords = True 
 qdfPassThrough.MaxRecords = 20 
 
 Set rstTemp = qdfPassThrough.OpenRecordset() 
 
 ' Display results of query. 
 Debug.Print "Query results:" 
 With rstTemp 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 Debug.Print , .Fields(0), .Fields(1) 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsCurrent.Close 
 
End Sub 
 

```
