A  **LookupRecord** data block performs a set of actions on a specific record.

 **Note**  The  **LookupRecord** data block is available only in Data Macros.


## Setting
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  **SetField** action has the following arguments.



|**Argument**|**Required**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _In_|Yes|A string that identifies the record to operate on. The  _In_ argument can contain the name of the table, a select query, or a SQL statement.
 **Note**  The specified record cannot include data stored in a linked table or ODBC data source.

|
| _Where Condition_|No|A string expression used to restrict the range of data on which the  **LookupRecord** data block is performed. For example, criteria are often equivalent to the WHERE clause in an SQL expression, without the word WHERE. If criteria are omitted, the **LookupRecord** data block operates on the entire domain specified by the _In_ argument. Any field that is included in criteria must also be a field in _In_.|
| _Alias_|No|A string that provides an alternative name for the record specified by the  _In_ argument. Often used to shorten the table name for subsequent references to prevent possible ambiguous references. If _Alias_ is not specified, the table or query name will be used as the alias.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If the criteria specified by the  _In_ and _Where Condition_ arguments specifies more than one record, the **LookupRecord** data block will operate only on the first record.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **SetReturnVar** action to return a value from a named data macro. A **ReturnVar** named **CurrentServiceRequest** is returned to the macro or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) subroutine that called the named data macro.

 **Sample code provided by:** The[Microsoft Access 2010 Programmer's Reference](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Access-2010-Programmer-s-Reference.productCd-0470591668.mdl)




```
RunDataMacro
    Macro Name tblServiceRequests.dmGetCurrentServiceRequest

Parameters
    prmAssignedTo =[ID]

SetProperty
    Control Name txtCurrentSR
    Property Value
    Value =[ReturnVars]![CurrentServiceRequest]
```

The following example shows how to use the  **RaiseError** action to cancel the **Before Change** data macro event. When the **AssignedTo** field is updated, a **LookupRecord** data block is used to determine whether the assigned technician is currently assigned to an open service request. If this is true, the **Before Change** event is cancelled and the record is not updated.




```
/* Get the name of the technician  */
Look Up A Record In tblTechnicians
    Where Condition =[tblTechnicians].[ID]=[tblServiceRequests].[AssignedTo]
SetLocalVar
    Name TechName
    Expression [tblTechnicians].[FirstName] &amp; " " &amp; [tblTechnicians].[LastName]
/* End LookUpRecord  */

If Updated("AssignedTo") Then
    Look Up A Record In tblServiceRequests
        Where Condition SR.[AssignedTo]=tblServiceRequests[AssignedTo] And 
            SR.[ID]<>tblServiceRequests.[ID] And IsNull(SR.[ActualCompletionDate])
        Alias SR
        RaiseError
            Error Number 1234
            Error Description ="Cannot assign a request to the specified technician: " &amp; [TechName]

End If
```
