Sets or returns a value indicating the type of locking that is in effect while editing.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **LockEdits**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The setting or return value indicates the type of locking, as specified in the following table.



|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|True|Default. Pessimistic locking is in effect. The page containing the record you're editing is locked as soon as you call the Edit method.|
|False|Optimistic locking is in effect for editing. The page containing the record is not locked until the Update method is executed.|
You can use the  **LockEdits** property with updatable **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** objects.

If a page is locked, no other user can edit records on the same page. If you set  **LockEdits** to **True** and another user already has the page locked, an error occurs when you use the **Edit** method. Other users can read data from locked pages.

If you set the  **LockEdits** property to **False** and later use the **Update** method while another user has the page locked, an error occurs. To see the changes made to your record by another user, use the **[Move](df39c05e-c5f8-3b66-fa5f-c91b687c147d.md)** method with 0 as the argument; however, if you do this, you will lose your changes.

When working with Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC data sources, the  **LockEdits** property is always set to **False**, or optimistic locking. The Microsoft Access database engine has no control over the locking mechanisms used in external database servers.




 **Note**  You can preset the value of  **LockEdits** when you first open the **Recordset** by setting the _lockedits_ argument of the **[OpenRecordset](584a3e00-7589-90f1-aa6a-5d6116f0b5b6.md)** method. Setting the _lockedits_ argument to **dbPessimistic** will set the **LockEdits** property to **True**, and setting _lockedits_ to any other value will set the **LockEdits** property to **False**.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example demonstrates pessimistic locking by setting the  **LockEdits** property to **True**, and then demonstrates optimistic locking by setting the **LockEdits** property to False. It also demonstrates what kind of error handling is required in a multiuser database environment in order to modify a field. The PessimisticLock and OptimisticLock functions are required for this procedure to run.
