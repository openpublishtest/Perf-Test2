[Syntax](#sectionSection1)
[Return Value](#sectionSection2)
[Parameters](#sectionSection3)
[Remarks](#sectionSection4)



Indicates a specific member of a collection, by name or ordinal number.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 **Set** _object_ = _collection_. **Item** ( Index )


## Return Value
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Returns an object reference.


## Parameters
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>


-  _Index_
    
- A  **Variant** expression that evaluates either to the name or to the ordinal number of an object in a collection.
    

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection4"> </a>

Use the  **Item** property to return a specific object in a collection. If **Item** cannot find an object in the collection corresponding to the _Index_ argument, an error occurs. Also, some collections don't support named objects; for these collections, you must use ordinal number references.

The  **Item** property is the default property for all collections; therefore, the following syntax forms are interchangeable:




```
collection.Item (Index)
collection (Index)

```
