Specifies the type of cursor used in a [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object.


|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**adOpenDynamic**|2|Uses a dynamic cursor. Additions, changes, and deletions by other users are visible, and all types of movement through the  **Recordset** are allowed, except for bookmarks, if the provider doesn't support them.|
|**adOpenForwardOnly**|0|Default. Uses a forward-only cursor. Identical to a static cursor, except that you can only scroll forward through records. This improves performance when you need to make only one pass through a  **Recordset**.|
|**adOpenKeyset**|1|Uses a keyset cursor. Like a dynamic cursor, except that you can't see records that other users add, although records that other users delete are inaccessible from your  **Recordset**. Data changes by other users are still visible.|
|**adOpenStatic**|3|Uses a static cursor. A static copy of a set of records that you can use to find data or generate reports. Additions, changes, or deletions by other users are not visible.|
|**adOpenUnspecified**|-1|Does not specify the type of cursor.|
