Contains the [Axis](a4332b69-8900-08f1-a4e2-9395d005ed42.md) objects that define a cellset.

## Remarks

A [Cellset](28d4b3b9-f907-9ec0-00e1-9666c887cdf0.md) object contains an **Axes** collection. Once the **Cellset** is opened, this collection will contain at least one **Axis**. See the[Axis](a4332b69-8900-08f1-a4e2-9395d005ed42.md) object for a more detailed explanation of how to use **Axis** objects.


 **Note**  The filter axis of a  **Cellset** is not contained in the **Axes** collection. See the[FilterAxis](36720d77-4b16-1d17-6d80-d35265f4a8ad.md) property for more information.

 **Axes** is a standard ADO collection. With the properties and methods of a collection, you can do the following:


- Obtain the number of objects in the collection with the [Count](b59f9581-ffd1-471d-44fa-3c1bb812e140.md) property.
    
- Return an object from the collection with the default [Item](793c305f-0e5b-a529-e21f-b7ab0843ed49.md) property.
    
- Update the objects in the collection from the provider with the [Refresh](f1c8829f-9c7d-12b6-7470-727ff38d663e.md) method.
