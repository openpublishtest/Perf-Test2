# Unable to change Column Level Tracking Property on objects that are already Replicable. (Error 3779)

Once an object is made replicable, the Column Level Tracking Property cannot be changed. If you want to change the tracking of the object, the object must be made local again. Then you can change the Column Level Tracking Property and make the object replicable again.
