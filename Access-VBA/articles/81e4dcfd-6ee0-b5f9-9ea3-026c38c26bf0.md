## Step 2: Initialize the Main List Box

 **To declare global Record and Recordset objects**


- Insert the following code into the (General) (Declarations) for Form1:
    
  ```
   
Option Explicit 
Dim grec As Record 
Dim grs As Recordset 

  ```


     This code declares global object references for **Record** and **Recordset** objects that will be used later in this scenario.
    
 **To connect to a URL and populate lstMain**


- Insert the following code into the Form Load event handler for Form1:
    
  ```
   
Private Sub Form_Load() 
    Set grec = New Record 
    Set grs = New Recordset 
    grec.Open "", "URL=http://servername/foldername/", , _ 
        adOpenIfExists Or adCreateCollection 
    Set grs = grec.GetChildren 
    While Not grs.EOF 
        lstMain.AddItem grs(0) 
        grs.MoveNext 
    Wend 
End Sub 

  ```


     This code instantiates the global **Record** and **Recordset** objects. The **Record**, `grec`, is opened with a URL specified as the  **ActiveConnection**. If the URL exists, it is opened; if it does not already exist, it is created. Note that you should replace "http://servername/foldername/" with a valid URL from your environment. The **Recordset**, `grs`, is opened on the children of the  **Record**, `grec`. Then lstMain is populated with the file names of the resources published to the URL.
