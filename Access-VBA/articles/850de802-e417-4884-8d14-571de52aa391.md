 **OpenPopup** ( _View_, _Where=_, _Order By_ )

The  **OpenPopup** action contains the following arguments.



|**Argument name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _View_|The name of the view to open.|
| _Where=_|A valid SQL WHERE clause (without the word WHERE) that restricts the records in the view.|
| _Order By_|A string expression that includes the name of the field or fields on which to sort records and the optional ASC or DESC keywords. By default, this argument is blank.|

## Remarks

The current macro ends once the  **OpenPopup** action is processed.

Any sorting or filtering applied by the user is cleared when the  **OpenPopup** action is called.

The  _OrderBy_ argument is the name of the field or fields on which you want to sort records. When you use more than one field name, separate the names with a comma (,).

When you set the  _OrderBy_ argument, the records are sorted by default in ascending order.
