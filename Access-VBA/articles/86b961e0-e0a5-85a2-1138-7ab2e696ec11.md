To edit existing records, move to the row you want to edit and change the  **Value** property of the fields you want to change. For more information about the **Field** object's **Value** property, see[Chapter 3: Examining Data](73c69134-3127-3344-d5c3-5ecb9e0e958b.md). Depending on your cursor type, you will use  **Update** or **UpdateBatch** to send changes back to the data source. For more information, see[Chapter 5: Updating and Persisting Data](77acb763-1c60-1945-791d-3e83d684fb0d.md).

It is usually more efficient to use a stored procedure with a command object to perform updates, as well as to perform other operations, because a stored procedure does not require the creation of a cursor. For more information about cursors, see [Chapter 8: Understanding Cursors and Locks](889356f9-53ca-3c46-6781-b37e1f065717.md).
