If you have set your document window options to use overlapping windows instead of tabbed documents, you can use the  **MoveAndSizeWindow** action to move or resize the active window. For information on how to set document window options, see the Remarks section.

## Setting
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  **MoveAndSizeWindow** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Right**|The new horizontal position of the window's upper-left corner, measured from the left edge of its containing window. Enter the position in the  **Right** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the Macro Builder pane.|
|**Down**|The new vertical position of the window's upper-left corner, measured from the top edge of its containing window.|
|**Width**|The window's new width.|
|**Height**|The window's new height.|
If you leave an argument blank, Microsoft Access uses the window's current setting.

You must enter a value for at least one argument.


 **Note**  Each measurement is in inches or centimeters, depending on the regional settings in Windows Control Panel.


## Remarks

To set up an application to use overlapping windows instead of tabbed documents, use the following procedure:


1.  and then click **Options**
    
2. Click  **Current Database**.
    
3. In the  **Application Options** section, under **Document Window Options**, click  **Overlapping Windows**.
    
4. Click  **OK**, and then close and reopen the database.
    
This action is similar to clicking  **Move** or **Size** on the window's **Control** menu. With the menu commands, you use the keyboard's arrow keys to move or resize the window. With the **MoveAndSizeWindow** action, you enter the position and size measurements directly. You can also use the mouse to move and size windows.

You can use this action on any window, in any view.

 **Tips**


- To move a window without resizing it, enter values for the  **Right** and **Down** arguments but leave the **Width** and **Height** arguments blank.
    
- To resize a window without moving it, enter values for the  **Width** and **Height** arguments but leave the **Right** and **Down** arguments blank.
    
To run the  **MoveAndSizeWindow** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **MoveSize** method of the **DoCmd** object.

 **Synchronize forms by using a macro**

The following macro opens a Product List form in the lower-right corner of the Suppliers form, displaying the current supplier's products. It shows the use of the  **Echo**, **MessageBox**, **GoToControl**, **StopMacro**, **OpenForm**, and **MoveAndSizeWindow** actions. It also shows the use of a conditional expression with the **MessageBox**, **GoToControl**, and **StopMacro** actions. This macro should be attached to the Review Products button on the Suppliers form.
