## Remarks

For example, suppose you are building a custom wizard that provides the user with a choice of fields on which to group data when designing a report. Call the  **CreateGroupLevel** method from your wizard to create the appropriate groups according to the user's choice.

You can use the  **CreateGroupLevel** method when designing a wizard that creates a report with groups or totals. The **CreateGroupLevel** method groups or sorts data on the specified field or expression and creates a header and/or footer for the group level.

The  **CreateGroupLevel** method is available only in report Design view.

Microsoft Access uses an array, the  **[GroupLevel](8a40502d-84ac-0652-8c07-c4c155ec1242.md)** property array, to keep track of the group levels created for a report. The **CreateGroupLevel** method adds a new group level to the array, based on the _expression_ argument. The **CreateGroupLevel** method then returns an index value that represents the new group level's position in the array. The first field or expression you sort or group on is level 0, the second is level 1, and so on. You can have up to ten group levels in a report (0 to 9).

When you specify that either the  _header_ or _footer_ argument, or both, is **True**, the **[GroupHeader](336e45dc-595e-a3fd-9d6b-9e1153654602.md)** and **[GroupFooter](c10d30b2-da18-cd6f-8b00-e964cd4751d6.md)** properties in a report are set to Yes, and a header and/or footer is created for the group level.

Once a header or footer is created, you can set other GroupLevel properties:  **[GroupOn](7fb9551f-5742-39a2-1cf3-7b3975ae517a.md)**, **[GroupInterval](98ba66b9-658e-9fa6-155b-3b4f1a7c3f01.md)**, and **[KeepTogether](65bc99df-7b0f-ec66-5add-0943ef0cd1f3.md)**.


 **Note**  If your wizard creates group levels in a new or existing report, it must open the report in Design view.


## Example

The following example creates a group level on an OrderDate field on a report called OrderReport. The report on which the group level is to be created must be open in Design view. Since the  _header_ and _footer_ arguments are set to **True** (?1), the method creates both the header and footer for the group level. The header and footer are then sized.


```
Sub CreateGL() 
 Dim varGroupLevel As Variant 
 
 ' Create new group level on OrderDate field. 
 varGroupLevel = CreateGroupLevel("OrderReport", "OrderDate", _ 
 True, True) 
 ' Set height of header/footer sections. 
 Reports!OrderReport.Section(acGroupLevel1Header).Height = 400 
 Reports!OrderReport.Section(acGroupLevel1Footer).Height = 400 
End Sub 

```
