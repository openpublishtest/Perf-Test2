It is important to understand how cursors operate so you can select the best and most efficient cursor type for an application's data-access requirements. A less-than-optimal cursor configuration can make data-access operations painfully slow.

Many capabilities of the ADO  **Recordset** object are determined by the type and location of the cursor, as well as the lock type.
