The  **EndOfRecordset** event is called when there is an attempt to move to a row past the end of the[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

 **EndOfRecordset** _fMoreData_, _adStatus_, _pRecordset_


## Parameters
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>


-  _fMoreData_
    
- A  **VARIANT_BOOL** value that, if set to VARIANT_TRUE, indicates more rows have been added to the **Recordset**.
    
-  _adStatus_
    
- [EventStatusEnum](ae1711bc-2af5-04fd-7d8c-222d8afc9d3d.md)
    
    When  **EndOfRecordset** is called, this parameter is set to **adStatusOK** if the operation that caused the event was successful. It is set to **adStatusCantDeny** if this event cannot request cancellation of the operation that caused this event.
    
    Before  **EndOfRecordset** returns, set this parameter to **adStatusUnwantedEvent** to prevent subsequent notifications.
    
-  _pRecordset_
    
- A  **Recordset** object. The **Recordset** for which this event occurred.
    

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

An  **EndOfRecordset** event may occur if the[MoveNext](d04ce41c-77c9-df42-115a-65c50a38518a.md) operation fails.

This event handler is called when an attempt is made to move past the end of the  **Recordset** object, perhaps as a result of calling **MoveNext**. However, while in this event, you could retrieve more records from a database and append them to the end of the **Recordset**. In that case, set _fMoreData_ to VARIANT_TRUE, and return from **EndOfRecordset**. Then call **MoveNext** again to access the newly retrieved records.
