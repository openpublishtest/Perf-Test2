A  **Recordset** created by a clause of a shape command may be assigned an _alias_ name (typically with the AS keyword). The alias of a shaped **Recordset** can be referenced in an entirely different command. That is, you may reuse, or _reshape_, a previously shaped **Recordset** in a new shape command. To support this feature, ADO provides a property,[Reshape Name](59ef99c8-da40-5cf6-b987-d47ea1433f45.md).

Reshaping has two main functions. The first is to associate an existing  **Recordset** with a new parent **Recordset**.

## Example


```
 
. . . 
rs1.Open "SHAPE {select * from Customers} " &amp; _ 
 "APPEND ({select * from Orders} AS chapOrders " &amp; _ 
 "RELATE CustomerID to CustomerID)", cn 
 
rs2.Open "SHAPE {select * from Employees} " &amp; _ 
 "APPEND (chapOrders RELATE EmployeeID to EmployeeID)", cn 
. . . 

```

The second function is to enable non-chaptered access to existing child  **Recordset** objects, using the syntax "SHAPE <recordset reshape name>".


 **Note**  You cannot append columns to an existing  **Recordset**, reshape a parameterized **Recordset** or the **Recordset** objects in any intervening COMPUTE clause, or perform aggregate operations on any **Recordset** descendant from the **Recordset** being reshaped. The **Recordset** being reshaped and the new shape command must both use the same[Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md).
