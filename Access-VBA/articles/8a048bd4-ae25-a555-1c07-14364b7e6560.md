## Settings And Return Values

Sets or returns a  **Long** value that can be set to one of the[CursorLocationEnum](520cc738-998b-ce80-6362-0df310c40c39.md) values.


## Remarks

This property allows you to choose between various cursor libraries accessible to the provider. Usually, you can choose between using a client-side cursor library or one that is located on the server.

This property setting affects connections established only after the property has been set. Changing the  **CursorLocation** property has no effect on existing connections.

Cursors returned by the [Execute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/af190bd9-7167-df59-29ca-a9a86c4957fd%28Office.15%29.aspx) method inherit this setting. **Recordset** objects will automatically inherit this setting from their associated connections.

This property is read/write on a [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) or a closed[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md), and read-only on an open  **Recordset**.

 **Remote Data Service Usage** When used on a client-side **Recordset** or **Connection** object, the **CursorLocation** property can only be set to **adUseClient**.
