# Report.GroupLevel Property (Access)

You can use the  **GroupLevel** property in Visual Basic to refer to the group level you are grouping or sorting on in a report. Read-only **GroupLevel** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **GroupLevel**( ** _Index_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Report** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Index_|Required|**Long**|The group level, starting with 0. The first field or expression you group on is group level 0, the second is group level 1, and so on.|

## Remarks

The following sample settings show how you use the  **GroupLevel** property to refer to a group level.



|**Group level**|**Refers to**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**GroupLevel** (0)|The first field or expression you sort or group on.|
|**GroupLevel** (1)|The second field or expression you sort or group on.|
|**GroupLevel** (2)|The third field or expression you sort or group on.|
The  **GroupLevel** property setting is an array in which each entry identifies a group level. You can have up to 10 group levels (0 to 9).


 **Note**  You can use this property only by using Visual Basic to set the  **[SortOrder](2c58785c-4ddb-a581-b438-5f6390f544dd.md)**, **[GroupOn](7fb9551f-5742-39a2-1cf3-7b3975ae517a.md)**, **[GroupInterval](98ba66b9-658e-9fa6-155b-3b4f1a7c3f01.md)**, **[KeepTogether](65bc99df-7b0f-ec66-5add-0943ef0cd1f3.md)**, and **ControlSource** properties. You set these properties in the **[Open](d170b67d-3123-6f51-6cf8-38433736f104.md)** event procedure of a report.

In reports, you can group or sort on more than one field or expression. Each field or expression you group or sort on is a group level.

You specify the fields and expressions to sort and group on by using the  **[CreateGroupLevel](880c1e36-b7b5-7ea4-a2ca-d7c3f0a5a7be.md)** method.

If a group is already defined for a report (the  **GroupLevel** property is set to 0), then you can use the **ControlSource** property to change the group level in the report's Open event procedure.


## Example

The following code changes the  **ControlSource** property to a value contained in the `txtPromptYou`text box on the open form named  `SortForm`:


```
Private Sub Report_Open(Cancel As Integer) 
 Me.GroupLevel(0).ControlSource _ 
 = Forms!SortForm!txtPromptYou 
End Sub
```
