# SetLocalVar Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

The  **SetLocalVar** action creates a temporary variable and set it to a specific value.


## Setting

The  **SetLocalVar** action has the following arguments.



|**Argument**|**Required**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Name**|Yes|A string that specifies the name of the variable.|
|**Expression**|Yes|An expression that will be used to set the value for this temporary variable. Do not precede the expression with the equal sign (=). You can click the  **Build** button to use the **Expression Builder** to set this argument.|

## Remarks

Variables created by the  **SetLocalVar** action can be used only in the macro in which they are defined. Use the **[SetTempVar](9c3b7bee-02c5-efbf-1276-4c4a1f7802d9.md)** action to define a variable that can be used in another macro, in an event procedure, or on a form or report.

Once a temporary variable has been created, you can refer to it in an expression. For example, if you created a temporary variable named TotalAmount, you could use the variable as the control source for a text box by using the following syntax.




```
=[LocalVars]![TotalAmount]
```


 **Note**  In a Data Macro, you do not have to use the LocalVars collection to refer to a variable. For example, if you created a temporary variable in a Data Macro named TotalAmount, you could use the variable as the control source for a text box by using the following syntax `=[TotalAmount]`
