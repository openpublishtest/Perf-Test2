|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ViewName_|Required|**Variant**|A string expression that's the valid name of a view in the current database. If you execute Visual Basic code containing the  **OpenView** method in a library database, Microsoft Access looks for the view with this name first in the library database, then in the current database.|
| _View_|Optional|**AcView**|A  **[AcView](708b0b90-8144-be34-f312-6914d4aa8e68.md)** constant that specifies the view in which the view will open. The default value is **acViewNormal**.|
| _DataMode_|Optional|**AcOpenDataMode**|A  **[AcOpenDataMode](e50b49fd-b77e-5ee5-d973-59ef46faddd7.md)** constant that specifies the data entry mode for the view. The default value is **acEdit**.|

## Remarks

In a Microsoft Access project, you can use the  **OpenView** method to open a view in Datasheet view, view Design view, or Print Preview. This action runs the named view when opened in Datasheet view. You can select data entry for the view and restrict the records that the view displays.

If you don't want to display the system messages that normally appear when a view is run (indicating it's a view and showing how many records will be affected), you can use the  **SetWarnings** method to suppress the display of these messages.


## Example

The following example opens the Employees view.


```
DoCmd.OpenView "Employees"
```
