# ConnectComplete and Disconnect Events (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



The  **ConnectComplete** event is called after a connection _starts_. The **Disconnect** event is called after a connection _ends_.

## Syntax

 **ConnectComplete** _pError_, _adStatus_, _pConnection_

 **Disconnect** _adStatus_, _pConnection_


## Parameters


-  _pError_
    
- An [Error](97e478bf-8b25-03a8-9358-abba5069cba3.md) object. It describes the error that occurred if the value of _adStatus_ is **adStatusErrorsOccurred**; otherwise it is not set.
    
-  _adStatus_
    
- [EventStatusEnum](ae1711bc-2af5-04fd-7d8c-222d8afc9d3d.md)
    
    When  **ConnectComplete** is called, this parameter is set to **adStatusCancel** if a **WillConnect** event has requested cancellation of the pending connection.
    
    Before either event returns, set this parameter to  **adStatusUnwantedEvent** to prevent subsequent notifications. However, closing and reopening the[Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) causes these events to occur again.
    
-  _pConnection_
    
- The  **Connection** object for which this event applies.
