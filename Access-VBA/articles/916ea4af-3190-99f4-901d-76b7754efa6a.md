# You cannot set the KeepLocal property for an object that is already replicated. (Error 3457)

The  **KeepLocal** property cannot be set on a replicated object. Setting a local object's **KeepLocal** property after the database has been replicated has no effect on the object. If you want to keep an object from being replicated to the other replicas in the set, set the object's **Replicable** property to "F".
