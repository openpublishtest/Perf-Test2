There are two basic types of events. "Will Events," which are called before an operation starts, usually include "Will" in their names — for example,  **WillChangeRecordset** or **WillConnect**. Events that are called after an event has been completed usually include "Complete" in their names — for example, **RecordChangeComplete** or **ConnectComplete**. Exceptions exist — such as **InfoMessage** — but these occur after the associated operation has completed.

## Will Events

Event handlers called before the operation starts offer you the opportunity to examine or modify the operation parameters, and then either cancel the operation or allow it to complete. These event-handler routines usually have names of the form  **Will _Event_**.


## Complete Events
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Event handlers called after an operation completes can notify your application that an operation has concluded. Such an event handler is also notified when a Will event handler cancels a pending operation. These event-handler routines usually have names of the form  ** _Event_ Complete**.

Will and Complete events are typically used in pairs.


## Other Events

The other event handlers — that is, events whose names are not of the form  **Will _Event_** or ** _Event_ Complete —** are called only after an operation completes. These events are **Disconnect**, **EndOfRecordset**, and **InfoMessage**.
