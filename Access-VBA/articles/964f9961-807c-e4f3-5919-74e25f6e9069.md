A  **Recordset2** object represents the records in a base table or the records that result from running a query.

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

A  **Recordset2** object is contains all of the same properties and methods as the **[Recordset](9774232C-E6DA-175B-FC7F-ED2AB7908FA0.md)** object. The **Recordset2** object contains a new property, **[ParentRecordset](816cc92e-e530-6ca6-65b0-3165221835a6.md)**, that support multi-valued field types.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The following example shows how to navigate a  **Recordset** that contains a multi-value field.

The following example shows how to navigate the files in an attachment field. The file type and filename of each attachment is printed in the Immediate window.




```
Sub ListAttachments()
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld As DAO.Field2
    
    'Get the database, recordset, and attachment field
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the table
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Print the first and last name
        Debug.Print rst("FirstName") &amp; " " &amp; rst("LastName")
        
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Print all attachments in the field
        Do While Not rsA.EOF
            Debug.Print , rsA("FileType"), rsA("FileName")
            
            'Next attachment
            rsA.MoveNext
        Loop
        
        rsA.Close
        
        'Next record
        rst.MoveNext
    Loop
    
        
    rst.Close
    dbs.Close
    
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set rsA = Nothing
    Set rst = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing

The following example shows how to add files from a specified folder path to an attachment field.




```
Public Function LoadAttachments(strPath As String, Optional strPattern As String = "*.*") As Long
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld  As DAO.Field2
    Dim strFile As String
    
    'Get the database, recordset, and attachment field
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the table
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Load all attachments in the specified directory
        strFile = Dir(strPath &amp; "\*.*")
        
        rst.Edit
        Do While Len(strFile) > 0
            'Add a new attachment that matches the pattern.
            'Pass "" to match all files.
            If strFile Like strPattern Then
                rsA.AddNew
                rsA("FileData").LoadFromFile strPath &amp; "\" &amp; strFile
                rsA.Update
                
                'Increment the number of files added
                LoadAttachments = LoadAttachments + 1
            End If
            strFile = Dir
        Loop
        rsA.Close
        
        rst.Update
        'Next record
        rst.MoveNext
    Loop
    
    rst.Close
    dbs.Close
    
    Set fld = Nothing
    Set rsA = Nothing
    Set rst = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Function
```

The following example shows how to save the files stored in an attachment field to the specified folder path.




```
Public Function SaveAttachments(strPath As String, Optional strPattern As String = "*.*") As Long
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2

    Dim strFullPath As String
    
    'Get the database, recordset, and attachment field
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the table
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Save all attachments in the field
        Do While Not rsA.EOF
            If rsA("FileName") Like strPattern Then
                strFullPath = strPath &amp; "\" &amp; rsA("FileName")
                
                'Make sure the file does not exist and save
                If Dir(strFullPath) = "" Then
                    rsA("FileData").SaveToFile strFullPath
                End If
                
                'Increment the number of files saved
                SaveAttachments = SaveAttachments + 1
            End If
            
            'Next attachment
            rsA.MoveNext
        Loop

The following example shows how to delete a file stored in an attachment field.




```

    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim rst As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim rsA As DAO.Recordset2
    Dim fld As DAO.Field2
    
    'Get the database
    Set dbs = CurrentDb
    
    'Open the recordset. If the strFilter is supplied, add it to the WHERE
    'clause for the recordset. Otherwise, any files matching strFileName
    'will be deleted
    If Len(strFilter) > 0 Then
        Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM tblAttachments WHERE " &amp; strFilter)
    Else
        Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset("tblAttachments")
    End If
    
    'Get the Attachment field
    Set fld = rst("Attachments")
    
    'Navigate through the recordset
    Do While Not rst.EOF
    
        'Get the recordset for the Attachments field
        Set rsA = fld.Value
        
        'Walk the attachments and look for the file name to remove
        Do While Not rsA.EOF
            If rsA("FileName") Like strRemoveFile Then
                rsA.Delete
                
                'Increment the number of files removed
                RemoveAttachment = RemoveAttachment + 1
            End If
            rsA.MoveNext
        Loop
                
        'Cleanup the Attachments recordset
        rsA.Close
        Set rsA = Nothing
        
        'Next record
        rst.MoveNext
    Loop
