## Parameters
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>


-  _DataControl_

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

You must set the [Connect](11aa3284-18e9-6d2d-761b-c25090370b77.md), [Server](17519dbe-a43a-1d0d-22c1-dc0def2f63ab.md), and [SQL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/210adcbb-5c89-150b-4c61-6a52dea9af56%28Office.15%29.aspx) properties before you use the **Refresh** method. All data-bound controls on the form associated with an **RDS.DataControl** object will reflect the new set of records. Any pre-existing[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object is released, and any unsaved changes are discarded. The **Refresh** method automatically makes the first record the current record.

It's a good idea to call the  **Refresh** method periodically when you work with data. If you retrieve data, and then leave it on your client machine for a while, it is likely to become out of date. It's possible that any changes you make will fail, because someone else might have changed the record and submitted changes before you.
