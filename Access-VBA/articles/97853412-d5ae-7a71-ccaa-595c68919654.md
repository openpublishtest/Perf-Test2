# Connection.QueryTimeout Property (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Sets or returns a value that specifies the number of seconds to wait before a timeout error occurs when a query is executed on an ODBC data source.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **QueryTimeout**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Connection** object.


## Remarks

The default value is 60.

When you're using an ODBC database, such as Microsoft SQL Server, there may be delays due to network traffic or heavy use of the ODBC server. Rather than waiting indefinitely, you can specify how long to wait.

When you use  **QueryTimeout** with a **[Connection](f469b04e-2539-6b53-31f2-85fe22fcc2fc.md)** or **[Database](6cf2ddf8-3957-a15e-5eeb-85f81c1e415e.md)** object, it specifies a global value for all queries associated with the database. You can override this value for a specific query by setting the **ODBCTimeout** property of the particular **[QueryDef](0b3d901c-345d-42a2-f5f1-fb09cc562e27.md)** object.
