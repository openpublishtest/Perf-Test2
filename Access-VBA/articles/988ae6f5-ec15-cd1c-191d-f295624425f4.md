# Databases Collection (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **Databases** collection contains all open **Database** objects opened or created in a **Workspace** object.


## Remarks

When you open an existing  **Database** object or create a new one from a **Workspace**, it is automatically appended to the **Databases** collection. When you close a **Database** object with the **[Close](9b1a77cb-da12-24d6-892f-a56be103d51d.md)** method, it is removed from the **Databases** collection but not deleted from disk. You should close all open **Recordset** objects before closing a **Database** object.

In a Microsoft Access workspace, the  **Name** property setting of a database is a string that specifies the path of the database file.

To refer to a  **Database** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:




-  **Databases** (0)
    
-  **Databases** (" _name_ ")
    
-  **Databases** ![ _name_ ]
    





 **Note**  You can open the same data source or database more than once, creating duplicate names in the  **Databases** collection. You should assign **Database** objects to object variables and refer to them by variable name.


## Example

This example creates a new  **Database** object and opens an existing **Database** object in the default **Workspace** object. Then it enumerates the **Database** collection and the **Properties** collection of each **Database** object.


```
Sub DatabaseObjectX() 
 
 Dim wrkAcc As Workspace 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim dbsNew As Database 
 Dim dbsLoop As Database 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("AccWorkspace", "admin", _ 
 "", dbUseJet) 
 
 ' Make sure there isn't already a file with the name of 
 ' the new database. 
 If Dir("NewDB.mdb") <> "" Then Kill "NewDB.mdb" 
 
 ' Create a new database with the specified 
 ' collating order. 
 Set dbsNew = wrkAcc.CreateDatabase("NewDB.mdb", _ 
 dbLangGeneral) 
 Set dbsNorthwind = wrkAcc.OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 ' Enumerate the Databases collection. 
 For Each dbsLoop In wrkAcc.Databases 
 With dbsLoop 
 Debug.Print "Properties of " &amp; .Name 
 ' Enumerate the Properties collection of each 
 ' Database object. 
 For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
 If prpLoop <> "" Then Debug.Print " " &amp; _ 
 prpLoop.Name &amp; " = " &amp; prpLoop 
 Next prpLoop 
 End With 
 Next dbsLoop 
 
 dbsNew.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 wrkAcc.Close 
 
End Sub 
 

```

This example uses  **CreateDatabase** to create a new, encrypted **Database** object.




```
Sub CreateDatabaseX() 
 
 Dim wrkDefault As Workspace 
 Dim dbsNew As DATABASE 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 ' Get default Workspace. 
 Set wrkDefault = DBEngine.Workspaces(0) 
 
 ' Make sure there isn't already a file with the name of 
 ' the new database. 
 If Dir("NewDB.mdb") <> "" Then Kill "NewDB.mdb" 
 
 ' Create a new encrypted database with the specified 
 ' collating order. 
 Set dbsNew = wrkDefault.CreateDatabase("NewDB.mdb", _ 
 dbLangGeneral, dbEncrypt) 
 
 With dbsNew 
 Debug.Print "Properties of " &amp; .Name 
 ' Enumerate the Properties collection of the new 
 ' Database object. 
 For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
 If prpLoop <> "" Then Debug.Print " " &amp; _ 
 prpLoop.Name &amp; " = " &amp; prpLoop 
 Next prpLoop 
 End With 
 
 dbsNew.Close 
 
End Sub 

```
