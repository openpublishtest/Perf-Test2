# QueryDef.StillExecuting Property (DAO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_





## Syntax

 _expression_. **StillExecuting**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **QueryDef** object.


## Remarks

Use the  **StillExecuting** property to determine if the most recently called asynchronous **[Execute](ad9e859e-c6fe-496c-a1f2-a000cf4bebcc.md)** or **[OpenConnection](778a581f-be42-94ee-e5c6-4cbc1843450d.md)** method (that is, a method executed with the **dbRunAsync** option) is complete. While the **StillExecuting** property is **True**, any returned object cannot be accessed.

Once the  **StillExecuting** property returns **False**, following the **OpenConnection** call that returns the associated **[Connection](f469b04e-2539-6b53-31f2-85fe22fcc2fc.md)** object, the object can be referenced. So long as **StillExecuting** remains **True**, the object may not be referenced, other than to read the **StillExecuting** property.

Use the  **[Cancel](43ad7b64-823d-3fac-e4d4-5e9514f60011.md)** method to terminate execution of a task in progress.
