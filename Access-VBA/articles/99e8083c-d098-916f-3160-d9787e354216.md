# Not a valid bookmark. (Error 3159)

You tried to set a bookmark to an invalid string.

This error can occur if you set the  **Bookmark** property to a string that is invalid or was not saved from previously reading a **Bookmark** property. For example, the following code produces this error:



```VB.net
Sub SetBookmark() 
    Dim dbs As Database 
    Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
    Dim strPlaceholder As String 

    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 

    Set rstEmployees = _ 
        dbs.OpenRecordset _
        ("Employees", dbOpenDynaset) 

    strPlaceholder = "1" 

    rstEmployees.Bookmark = strPlaceholder    ' Not a valid bookmark. 
End Sub
```
