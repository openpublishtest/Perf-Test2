# Close a Report Automatically If It Does Not Contain Any Records

The following example shows how to use the  **[NoData](FA5F22B1-3695-BD16-2CA3-B2A1CC1F1D94.md)** event to cancel opening or printing a report when it has no data. A message box notifying the user that the report has no data is also displayed.

Private Sub Report_NoData (Cancel As Integer) 
     
    ' Display message to user. 
    MsgBox "There are no records to report", vbExclamation, "No Records" 
 
    ' Close the report. 
    Cancel = True 
 
End Sub
```
