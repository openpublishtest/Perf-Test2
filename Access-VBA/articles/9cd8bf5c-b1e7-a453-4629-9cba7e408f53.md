# PageCount Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates how many pages of data the [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object contains.

## Return Value

Returns a  **Long** value that indicates the number of pages in the **Recordset**.


## Remarks

Use the  **PageCount** property to determine how many pages of data are in the **Recordset** object. _Pages_ are groups of records whose size equals the[PageSize](da56edd8-8947-aeff-2ef5-a8535c66575b.md) property setting. Even if the last page is incomplete because there are fewer records than the **PageSize** value, it counts as an additional page in the **PageCount** value. If the **Recordset** object does not support this property, the value will be -1 to indicate that the **PageCount** is indeterminable.

See the  **PageSize** and[AbsolutePage](b6e5daac-cc21-0aa6-9119-a973595762bb.md) properties for more on page functionality.
