# Issuing Commands to the Underlying Data Provider

Any command that does not begin with SHAPE is passed through to the data provider. This is equivalent to issuing a shape command in the form "SHAPE {provider command}". These commands do  _not_ have to produce a **Recordset**. For instance, "SHAPE {DROP TABLE MyTable} is a perfectly valid shape command, assuming the data provider supports DROP TABLE.

This capability allows both normal provider commands and shape commands to share the same connection and transaction.
