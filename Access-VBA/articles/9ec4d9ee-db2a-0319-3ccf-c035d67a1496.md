    Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")

        &amp; "SELECT DISTINCTROW CategoryName, " _ 
        &amp; "CategoryID FROM Categories " _ 
        &amp; "ORDER BY CategoryName;" 
     
    ' Create a named QueryDef based on the SQL 
    ' statement. 
    Set qdf = dbs.CreateQueryDef("NewQry", strSql) 
 
    ' Create a temporary snapshot-type Recordset. 
    Set rst = qdf.OpenRecordset(dbOpenSnapshot) 
 
    ' Populate the Recordset. 
    rst.MoveLast 
             
    ' Call EnumFields to print the contents of the

    ' Delete the QueryDef because this is a 
    ' demonstration.

    dbs.Close 
 
End Sub
