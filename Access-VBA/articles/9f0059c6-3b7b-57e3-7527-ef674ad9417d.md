[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Updates the connection information for a linked table (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **RefreshLink**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TableDef** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

To change the connection information for a linked table, reset the  **[Connect](58b514a2-91cd-7918-cba5-15d71c2457a6.md)** property of the corresponding **TableDef** object and then use the **RefreshLink** method to update the information. Using **RefreshLink** method doesn't change the linked table's properties and **[Relation](46d6dfaf-a97d-3abd-0b4b-396a41eb3be7.md)** objects.

For this connection information to exist in all collections associated with the  **TableDef** object that represents the linked table, you must use the **[Refresh](f76c1a3f-1561-ce1f-a535-a5a2179ea739.md)** method on each collection.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **RefreshLink** method to refresh the data in a linked table after its connection has been changed from one data source to another. The RefreshLinkOutput procedure is required for this procedure to run.


```
Sub RefreshLinkX() 
 
 Dim dbsCurrent As Database 
 Dim tdfLinked As TableDef 
 
 ' Open a database to which a linked table can be 
 ' appended. 
 Set dbsCurrent = OpenDatabase("DB1.mdb") 
 
 ' Create a linked table that points to a Microsoft 
 ' SQL Server database. 
 Set tdfLinked = _ 
 dbsCurrent.CreateTableDef("AuthorsTable") 
 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 tdfLinked.Connect = _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers" 
 tdfLinked.SourceTableName = "authors" 
 dbsCurrent.TableDefs.Append tdfLinked 
 
 ' Display contents of linked table. 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "Data from linked table connected to first source:" 
 RefreshLinkOutput dbsCurrent 
 
 ' Change connection information for linked table and 
 ' refresh the connection in order to make the new data 
 ' available. 
 
 ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
 ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
 ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
 tdfLinked.Connect = _ 
 "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=NewPublishers" 
 tdfLinked.RefreshLink 
 
 ' Display contents of linked table. 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "Data from linked table connected to second source:" 
 RefreshLinkOutput dbsCurrent 
 
 ' Delete linked table because this is a demonstration. 
 dbsCurrent.TableDefs.Delete tdfLinked.Name 
 
 dbsCurrent.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Sub RefreshLinkOutput(dbsTemp As Database) 
 
 Dim rstRemote As Recordset 
 Dim intCount As Integer 
 
 ' Open linked table. 
 Set rstRemote = _ 
 dbsTemp.OpenRecordset("AuthorsTable") 
 
 intCount = 0 
 
 ' Enumerate Recordset object, but stop at 50 records. 
 With rstRemote 
 Do While Not .EOF And intCount < 50 
 Debug.Print , .Fields(0), .Fields(1) 
 intCount = intCount + 1 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 If Not .EOF Then Debug.Print , "[more records]" 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
End Sub
