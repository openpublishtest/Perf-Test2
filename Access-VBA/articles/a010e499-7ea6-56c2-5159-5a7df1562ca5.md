# Subform/Subreport Control

The subform/subreport control embeds a form in a form or a report in a report.

For example, you can use a form with a subform to present one-to-many relationships, such as one product category with the items that fall into that category. In this case, the main form can display the category ID, name, and description; the subform can display the available products in that category.

 **Tip**   Instead of creating the main form, and then adding the subform control to it, you can simultaneously create the main form and subform with a wizard. You can also create a subform or subreport by dragging an existing form or report from the Database window to the main form or report.
