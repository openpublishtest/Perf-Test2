# Cannot join more than one table with the same name <name>. (Error 3081)

You tried to join two or more tables that have the same name. Select different tables, rename one of the tables, or use an alias, and then try the operation again. If you are trying to join a table to itself, use a table alias to change the second reference to the table.
