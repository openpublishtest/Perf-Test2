# DefaultDatabase Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the default database for a [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a  **String** value that evaluates to the name of a database available from the provider.


## Remarks

Use the  **DefaultDatabase** property to set or return the name of the default database on a specific **Connection** object.

If there is a default database, SQL strings may use an unqualified syntax to access objects in that database. To access objects in a database other than the one specified in the  **DefaultDatabase** property, you must qualify object names with the desired database name. Upon connection, the provider will write default database information to the **DefaultDatabase** property. Some providers allow only one database per connection, in which case you cannot change the **DefaultDatabase** property.

Some data sources and providers may not support this feature, and may return an error or an empty string.

 **Remote Data Service Usage** This property is not available on a client-side **Connection** object.
