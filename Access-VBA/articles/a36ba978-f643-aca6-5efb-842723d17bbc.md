# AllMacros Object (Access)

The  **AllMacros** collection contains an **[AccessObject](8a770b33-5bff-120a-6707-ca214ee5ced3.md)** for each macro in the **[CurrentProject](e6baae73-1eeb-b48f-d35e-b3e921378561.md)** or **[CodeProject](70b71f57-df23-2cf7-23f5-147053a8ec26.md)** object.


## Remarks

The  **CurrentProject** or **CodeProject** object has an **AllMacros** collection containing **AccessObject** objects that describe instances of all the macros specified by **CurrentProject** or **CodeProject**. For example, you can enumerate the **AllMacros** collection in Visual Basic to set or return the values of properties of individual **AccessObject** objects in the collection.

You can refer to an individual  **AccessObject** object in the **AllMacros** collection either by referring to the object by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If you want to refer to a specific object in the **AllMacros** collection, it's better to refer to the macro by name because a macro's collection index may change.

The  **AllMacros** collection is indexed beginning with zero. If you refer to a macro by its index, the first macro is AllMacros(0), the second macro is AllMacros(1), and so on.


 **Note**   To list all open macros in the database, use the **[IsLoaded](5e68398c-8a95-f3e1-87ec-e2d637f34429.md)** property of each **AccessObject** object in the **AllMacros** collection. You can then use the **Name** property of each individual **AccessObject** object to return the name of a macro.

You can't add or delete an  **AccessObject** object from the **AllMacros** collection.


## Example

The following example prints the name of each open  **AccessObject** object in the **AllMacros** collection.


```
Sub AllMacros() 
 Dim obj As AccessObject, dbs As Object 
 Set dbs = Application.CurrentProject 
 ' Search for open AccessObject objects in AllMacros collection. 
 For Each obj In dbs.AllMacros 
 If obj.IsLoaded = True Then 
 ' Print name of obj. 
 Debug.Print obj.Name 
 End If 
 Next obj 
End Sub
```
