Microsoft Access supports dynamic data exchange (DDE) as either a destination (client) application or a source (server) application. For example, an application such as Microsoft Word, acting as a client, can request data through DDE from a Microsoft Access database that's acting as a server.

 **Tip**  If you need to manipulate Microsoft Access objects from another application, you may want to consider using Automation.

A DDE conversation between a client and server is established on a particular topic. A topic can be either a data file in the format supported by the server application, or it can be the System topic, which supplies information about the server application itself. Once a conversation has begun on a particular topic, only a data item associated with that topic can be transferred.
For example, suppose you are running Microsoft Word and want to insert data from a particular Microsoft Access database into a document. You begin a DDE conversation with Microsoft Access by opening a DDE channel with the  **DDEInitiate** function and specifying the database file name as the topic. You can then transfer data from that database to Microsoft Word through that channel.
As a DDE server, Microsoft Access supports the following topics:

- The System topic
    
- The name of a database ( _database_ topic)
    
- The name of a table ( _tablename_ topic)
    
- The name of a query ( _queryname_ topic)
    
- A Microsoft Access SQL string ( _sqlstring_ topic)
    
Once you've established a DDE conversation, you can use the  **DDEExecute** statement to send a command from the client to the server application. When used as a DDE server, Microsoft Access recognizes any of the following as a valid command:

- The name of a macro in the current database.
    
- Any action that you can carry out in Visual Basic by using one of the methods of the  **DoCmd** object.
    
- The OpenDatabase and CloseDatabase actions, which are used only for DDE operations. (For an example of how to use these actions, see the example later in this topic.)
    

 **Note**  When you specify a macro action as a  **DDEExecute** statement, the action and any arguments follow the **DoCmd** object syntax and must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]). However, applications that support DDE don't recognize intrinsic constants in DDE operations. Also, string arguments must be enclosed in quotation marks (" ") if the string contains a comma. Otherwise, quotation marks aren't required.

The client application can use the  **DDERequest** function to request text data from the server application over an open DDE channel. Or the client can use the **DDEPoke** statement to send data to the server application. Once the data transfer is complete, the client can use the **DDETerminate** statement to close the DDE channel, or the **DDETerminateAll** statement to close all open channels.

 **Note**  When your client application has finished receiving data over a DDE channel, it should close that channel to conserve memory resources.

The following example demonstrates how to create a Microsoft Word procedure with Visual Basic that uses Microsoft Access as a DDE server. (For this example to work, Microsoft Access must be running.)



```
Sub AccessDDE() 
    Dim intChan1 As Integer, intChan2 As Integer 
    Dim strQueryData As String 
 
    ' Use System topic to open Northwind sample database. 
    ' Database must be open before using other DDE topics. 
    intChan1 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "System") 
    ' You may need to change this path to point to actual location 
    ' of Northwind sample database. 
    DDEExecute intChan1, "[OpenDatabase C:\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb]" 
 
    ' Get all data from Ten Most Expensive Products query. 
    intChan2 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind.mdb;" _ 
        &amp; "QUERY Ten Most Expensive Products") 
    strQueryData = DDERequest(intChan2, "All") 
    DDETerminate intChan2 
 
    ' Close database. 
    DDEExecute intChan1, "[CloseDatabase]" 
    DDETerminate intChan1 
 
    ' Print retrieved data to Debug Window. 
    Debug.Print strQueryData 
End Sub
```

The following sections provide information about the valid DDE topics supported by Microsoft Access.

## The System Topic
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The System topic is a standard topic for all Microsoft Windows-based applications. It supplies information about the other topics supported by the application. To access this information, your code must first call the  **DDEInitiate** function with as the _topic_ argument, and then execute the **DDERequest** statement with one of the following supplied for the _item_ argument.



|**Item**|**Returns**|
|:-----|:-----|
|SysItems|A list of items supported by the System topic in Microsoft Access.|
|Formats|A list of the formats Microsoft Access can copy onto the Clipboard.|
|Status|"Busy" or "Ready".|
|Topics|A list of all open databases.|
The following example demonstrates the use of the  **DDEInitiate** and **DDERequest** functions with the System topic:




```
' In Visual Basic, initiate DDE conversation with Microsoft Access. 
Dim intChan1 As Integer, strResults As String 
intChan1 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "System") 
' Request list of topics supported by System topic. 
strResults = DDERequest(intChan1, "SysItems") 
' Run OpenDatabase action to open Northwind.mdb. 
' You may need to change this path to point to actual location 
' of Northwind sample database. 
DDEExecute intChan1, "[OpenDatabase C:\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb]"
```


## The
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  _database_ topic is the file name of an existing database. You can type either just the base name (Northwind), or its path and .mdb extension (C:\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb). After you start a DDE conversation with the database, you can request a list of the objects in that database.


 **Note**  You can't use DDE to query the Microsoft Access workgroup information file.

The  _database_ topic supports the following items.



|**Item**|**Returns**|
|:-----|:-----|
|TableList|A list of tables.|
|QueryList|A list of queries.|
|FormList|A list of forms.|
|ReportList|A list of reports.|
|MacroList|A list of macros.|
|ModuleList|A list of modules.|
|ViewList|A list of views|
|StoredProcedureList|A list of stored procedures|
|DatabaseDiagramList|A list of database diagrams|
The following example shows how you can open the Employees form in the Northwind sample database from a Visual Basic procedure:




```
' In Visual Basic, initiate DDE conversation with 
' Northwind sample database. 
' Make sure database is open. 
intChan2 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind") 
' Request list of forms in Northwind sample database. 
strResponse = DDERequest(intChan2, "FormList") 
' Run OpenForm action and arguments to open Employees form. 
DDEExecute intChan2, "[OpenForm Employees,0,,,1,0]"
```


## The TABLE
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

These topics use the following syntax:

 _databasename_ **; TABLE** _tablename_

 _databasename_ **; QUERY** _queryname_

 _databasename_ **; SQL [** _sqlstring_ **]**



|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _databasename_|The name of the database that the table or query is in or that the SQL statement applies to, followed by a semicolon (;). The database name can be just the base name (Northwind) or its full path and .mdb extension (C:\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb).|
| _tablename_|The name of an existing table.|
| _queryname_|The name of an existing query.|
| _sqlstring_|A valid SQL statement up to 256 characters long, ending with a semicolon. To exchange more than 256 characters, omit this argument and instead use successive  **DDEPoke** statements to build an SQL statement. For example, the following Visual Basic code uses the **DDEPoke** statement to build an SQL statement and then request the results of the query.|
|||
The following table lists the valid items for the TABLE  _tablename_, QUERY _queryname_, and SQL _sqlstring_ topics.



|**Item**|**Returns**|
|:-----|:-----|
|All|All the data in the table, including field names.|
|Data|All rows of data, without field names.|
|FieldNames|A single-row list of field names.|
|FieldNames;T|A two-row list of field names (first row) and their data types (second row).|
||These are the values returned and the data types they represent:|
||Value|Data type|
||0|Invalid|
||1|**True** / **False** (non- **Null** )|
||2|Unsigned byte|
||3|2-byte signed integer ( **Integer** )|
||4|4-byte signed integer ( **Long** )|
||5|8-byte signed integer ( **Currency** )|
||6|4-byte single-precision floating-point ( **Single** )|
||7|8-byte double-precision floating-point ( **Double** )|
||8|Date/Time|
||9|Binary data, 256 bytes maximum|
||10|ANSI text, not case-sensitive, 256 bytes maximum (Text)|
||11|Long binary (OLE Object)|
||12|Long text (Memo)|
|NextRow|The data in the next row in the table or query. When you open a channel, NextRow returns the data in the first row. If the current row is the last record and you run NextRow, the request fails.|
|PrevRow|The data in the previous row in the table or query. If PrevRow is the first request on a new channel, the data in the last row of the table or query is returned. If the first record is the current row, the request for PrevRow fails.|
|FirstRow|The data in the first row of the table or query.|
|LastRow|The data in the last row of the table or query.|
|FieldCount|The number of fields in the table or query.|
|SQLText|An SQL statement representing the table or query. For tables, this item returns an SQL statement in the form "SELECT * FROM  _table_;".|
|SQLText; _n_|An SQL statement, in  _n_ -character chunks, representing the table or query, where _n_ is an integer up to 256. For example, suppose a query is represented by the following SQL statement: The item "SQLText;7" returns the following tab-delimited chunks: The item "SQLText;7" returns the following tab-delimited chunks:|
The following example shows how you can use DDE in a Visual Basic procedure to request data from a table in the Northwind sample database and insert that data into a text file:




```
Sub NorthwindDDE 
    Dim intChan1 As Integer, intChan2 As Integer, intChan3 As Integer 
    Dim strResp1 As Variant, strResp2 As Variant, strResp3 As Variant 
 
    ' In a Visual Basic module, get data from Categories table, 
    ' Catalog query, and Orders table in Northwind.mdb. 
    ' Make sure database is open first. 
    intChan1 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind;TABLE Shippers") 
    intChan2 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind;QUERY Catalog") 
    intChan3 = DDEInitiate("MSAccess", "Northwind;SQL SELECT * " _ 
        &amp; "FROM Orders " _ 
        &amp; "WHERE OrderID > 10050;") 
 
    strResp1 = DDERequest(intChan1, "All") 
    strResp2 = DDERequest(intChan2, "FieldNames;T") 
    strResp3 = DDERequest(intChan3, "FieldNames;T") 
    DDETerminate intChan1 
    DDETerminate intChan2 
    DDETerminate intChan3 
 
    ' Insert data into text file. 
    Open "C:\DATA.TXT" For Append As #1 
    Print #1, strResp1 
    Print #1, strResp2 
    Print #1, strResp3 
    Close #1 
End Sub
```
