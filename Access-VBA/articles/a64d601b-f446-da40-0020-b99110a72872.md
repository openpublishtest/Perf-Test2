Copies the current record from an updatable  **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object to the copy buffer for subsequent editing.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Edit**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Once you use the  **Edit** method, changes made to the current record's fields are copied to the copy buffer. After you make the desired changes to the record, use the **[Update](aad4171a-da95-ed72-86b3-714615ea0ac8.md)** method to save your changes.

The current record remains current after you use  **Edit**.




 **Note**  If you edit a record and then perform any operation that moves to another record, but without first using  **Update**, your changes are lost without warning. In addition, if you close _recordset_ or end the procedure which declares the **Recordset** or the parent **[Database](6cf2ddf8-3957-a15e-5eeb-85f81c1e415e.md)** or **[Connection](f469b04e-2539-6b53-31f2-85fe22fcc2fc.md)** object, your edited record is discarded without warning.

Using  **Edit** produces an error if:




- There is no current record.
    
- The  **Connection**, **Database**, or **Recordset** object was opened as read-only.
    
- No fields in the record are updatable.
    
- The  **Database** or **Recordset** was opened for exclusive use by another user (Microsoft Access workspace).
    
- Another user has locked the page containing your record (Microsoft Access workspace).
    


In a Microsoft Access workspace, when the  **Recordset** object's **[LockEdits](baa11b24-a330-eaa4-bd03-b8b9739d209e.md)** property setting is **True** (pessimistically locked) in a multiuser environment, the record remains locked from the time **Edit** is used until the update is complete. If the **LockEdits** property setting is **False** (optimistically locked), the record is locked and compared with the pre-edited record just before it's updated in the database. If the record has changed since you used the **Edit** method, the **Update** operation fails with a run-time error if you use **OpenRecordset** without specifying **dbSeeChanges**. By default, Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC and installable ISAM databases always use optimistic locking.




 **Note**  To add, edit, or delete a record, there must be a unique index on the record in the underlying data source. If not, a "Permission denied" error will occur on the  **[AddNew](18cb35f6-8652-fb20-2460-3d13fae39d23.md)**, **[Delete](a8e249e7-7526-3eff-a5cf-70cab2081970.md)**, or **Edit** method call in a Microsoft Access workspace.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **Edit** method to replace the current data with the specified name. The EditName procedure is required for this procedure to run.


```
Sub EditX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim strOldFirst As String 
 Dim strOldLast As String 
 Dim strFirstName As String 
 Dim strLastName As String 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 
 ' Store original data. 
 strOldFirst = rstEmployees!FirstName 
 strOldLast = rstEmployees!LastName 
 
 ' Get new data for record. 
 strFirstName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
 "Enter first name:")) 
 strLastName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
 "Enter last name:")) 
 
 ' Proceed if the user entered something for both fields. 
 If strFirstName <> "" and strLastName <> "" Then 
 ' Update record with new data. 
 EditName rstEmployees, strFirstName, strLastName 
 
 With rstEmployees 
 ' Show old and new data. 
 Debug.Print "Old data: " &amp; strOldFirst &amp; _ 
 " " &amp; strOldLast 
 Debug.Print "New data: " &amp; !FirstName &amp; _ 
 " " &amp; !LastName 
 ' Restore original data because this is a 
 ' demonstration. 
 .Edit 
 !FirstName = strOldFirst 
 !LastName = strOldLast 
 .Update 
 End With 
 
 Else 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "You must input a string for first and last name!" 
 End If 
 
 rstEmployees.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Sub EditName(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
 strFirst As String, strLast As String) 
 
 ' Make changes to record and set the bookmark to keep 
 ' the same record current. 
 With rstTemp 
 .Edit 
 !FirstName = strFirst 
 !LastName = strLast 
 .Update 
 .Bookmark = .LastModified 
 End With 
 
End Sub 

```
