# DeleteObject Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **DeleteObject** action to delete a specified database object.


 **Note**  This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the  **See Also** section of this article.


## Setting

The  **DeleteObject** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Object Type**|The type of object to delete. Click  **Table**,  **Query**,  **Form**,  **Report**,  **Macro**,  **Module**,  **Data Access Page**,  **Server View**,  **Diagram**,  **Stored Procedure**, or  **Function** in the **Object Type** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the Macro Builder pane. To delete the object selected in the Navigation Pane, leave this argument blank.|
|**Object Name**|The name of the object to delete. The  **Object Name** box shows all objects in the database of the type selected by the **Object Type** argument. If you leave the **Object Type** box blank, leave this box blank also. If you run a macro containing the **DeleteObject** action in a library database, Microsoft Office Access 2007 first looks for the object with this name in the library database, and then in the current database.|

 **Caution**  If you leave the  **Object Type** and **Object Name** boxes blank, Access deletes the object selected in the Navigation Pane without displaying a warning message when it encounters the **DeleteObject** action.


## Remarks

You can use the  **DeleteObject** action to delete temporary objects you have created while running the macro. For example, you could use the **OpenQuery** action to run a make-table query that creates a temporary table. When you are finished using the temporary table, you can use the **DeleteObject** action to delete it.

This action has the same effect as selecting an object in the Navigation Pane and then pressing the DEL key, or right-clicking the object in the Navigation Pane and clicking  **Delete**.

To run the  **DeleteObject** action in a Visual Basic for Applications module, you can use the **DeleteObject** method of the **DoCmd** object.
