|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**adCopyAllowEmulation**|4|Indicates that the  _Source_ provider attempts to simulate the copy using download and upload operations if this method fails due to _Destination_ being on a different server or is serviced by a different provider than _Source_. Note that differing provider capabilities may hamper performance or lose data.|
|**adCopyNonRecursive**|2|Copies the current directory, but none of its subdirectories, to the destination. The copy operation is not recursive.|
|**adCopyOverWrite**|1|Overwrites the file or directory if the  _Destination_ points to an existing file or directory.|
|**adCopyUnspecified**|-1|Default. Performs the default copy operation: The operation fails if the destination file or directory already exists, and the operation copies recursively.|
