# CurrentProject.Connection Property (Access)

You can use the  **Connection** property to return a reference to the current ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) **Connection** object and its related properties. Read-only **Connection**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Connection**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CurrentProject** object.


## Remarks

Use the  **Connection** property to refer to the **Connection** object of the current Microsoft Access project (.adp) or Access database object. You can use the **Connection** property to call methods on the **Connection** object such as **BeginTrans** and **CommitTrans**.


 **Note**  The  **Connection** property actually returns a reference to a copy of the ActiveX Data Object (ADO) connection for the active database. Thus, applying the **Close** method or in anyway attempting to alter the connection through the **Connection** object's methods or properties will have no affect on the actual connection object used by Microsoft Access to hold a live connection to the current database. Since the **Connection** property is the main Shape provider connection, the following information is necessary when using this property.
