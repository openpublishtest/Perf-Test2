# Could not parse field names from the first row of the import table. (Error 3245)

The first row of data contains invalid field names, such as quoted and unquoted strings in the same field name. In the following example, the third and fourth field names cannot be parsed:


```
"Name", Date, "ID " Number, Phone" Number"

```


The first two fields are valid, but the third and fourth are not because they contain nonspace characters outside the quotation marks.

Check the import table for properly matched quotation marks, and then try the import operation again
