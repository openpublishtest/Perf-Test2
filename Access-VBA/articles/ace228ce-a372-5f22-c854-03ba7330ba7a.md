ADO is a COM automation interface component that can be used with many programming languages, including Microsoft Visual Basic, VBScript, JScript, Visual C++, and Visual J++. A version of ADO is installed with each of these tools and other applications, such as Microsoft Office and Microsoft SQL Server. See the [Data Platform Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/default.aspx) for more information.

The library for ADO is msado15.dll and the program ID (ProgID) prefix is "ADODB." For example, to explicitly refer to an ADO [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md), use .
