## Remarks

For example, if you want to prevent users from switching the Navigation Pane so that it displays objects sorted by  **Created Date**, you can use this method to hide that option in the title bar's drop-down list.

The caption in the title bar of the Navigation Pane indicates which filter, if any, is currently active. Click anywhere in the bar to display the drop-down list. The items that this method controls are listed under  **Navigate to Category**.

This method only enables or disables the display of the specified category or categories; it does not perform any switching of the Navigation Pane display. For example, if you are displaying objects sorted by  **Creation Date** and you use the **SetDisplayedCategories** method to disable the **Creation Date** option, Access does not switch the Navigation Pane to another category.
