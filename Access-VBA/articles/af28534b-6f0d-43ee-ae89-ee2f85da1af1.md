# StopMacro Macro Action (Access custom web app)
You can use the  **StopMacro** action to stop the currently running macro.

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

## Setting

The  **StopMacro** action doesn't have any arguments.


## Remarks

You typically use this action when a condition makes it necessary to stop the macro. For example, you might create a user interface (UI) macro that opens a view showing the daily order totals for the date entered in the current view. You could use a conditional expression to be sure that the Order Date control on the dialog box contains a valid date. If it doesn't, the  **MessageBox** action can display an error message and the **StopMacro** action can stop the UI macro.
