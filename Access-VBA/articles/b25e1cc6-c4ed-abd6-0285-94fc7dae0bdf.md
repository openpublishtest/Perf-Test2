You can use the  **BrowseTo** action to navigate between objects in place. You can also change the source object of a subform control by specifying the **Path to Subform Control** argument. Use **BrowseTo** to navigate from form1 to form2 without opening up a new window.

## Setting
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  **BrowseTo** action has the following argument.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _Object Type_|The object type to which to browse.|
| _Object Name_|The object that loads inside the subform control referenced by the  _Path to Subform Control_ argument.|
| _Path to Subform Control_|If specified, the path from the main form of the application to the target subform control that loads the object specified by the  _Object Name_ argument.|
| _Where Condition_|If specified, replaces the Where condition of the object record source.|
| _Page_|If specified, sets the page of the continuous form that will be made the current page. This argument is Web only.|
| _Data Mode_|If specified, the data entry mode of the form.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  _PathToSubFormControl_ argument must be specified using the syntax in the following code example:


```
Main Form.SubForm Ctrl 1>Form 2.SubForm Ctrl 2>Form 3.SubFormCtrl3
```

In this example, the Main Form is the top level form in the Access client application. The  _Path to Sub Form Control_ argument must alternately specify form and subform control names leading from the main form to the subform control that is the container of the object specified by the _Object Name_ argument. Each subform control specified must be a control on the form that precedes it. The path must end with a subform control.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **BrowseTo** action to open a report in a subform control or within a navigation control.
