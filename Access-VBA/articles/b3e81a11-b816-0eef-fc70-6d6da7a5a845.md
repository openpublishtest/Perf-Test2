# StartNewWorkflow Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **StartNewWorkflow** action to start a new workflow for an item in a linked Microsoft SharePoint Foundation list.


## Setting

The  **StartNewWorkflow** action has the following argument.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Record Number**|The position of the item in the SharePoint Foundation list, starting with  **1** for the first item in the list, **2** for the second item, and so on. You can also enter an expression for this argument.|

## Remarks


- The  **StartNewWorkflow** action opens the **Start New Workflow** dialog box. This dialog box displays all workflows that are available for the specified item. A workflow must be defined for the list in SharePoint Foundation before you can start it using this action.
    
- The  **StartNewWorkflow** action can only be used after a linked SharePoint list has been opened and selected. To open and select the linked list, use the **OpenTable** action. If the list is already open, use the **SelectObject** action to select it.
    
- The  **StartNewWorkflow** action has the same effect as right-clicking any cell in a linked SharePoint list while it is open in Datasheet view, pointing to **Workflow**, and then clicking  **Start New Workflow**.
    
- To run the  **StartNewWorkflow** action in a VBA module, use the **StartNewWorkflow** method of the **DoCmd** object.
