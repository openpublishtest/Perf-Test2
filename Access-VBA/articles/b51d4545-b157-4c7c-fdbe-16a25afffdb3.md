# Document Object (DAO)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **Document** object includes information about one instance of an object. The object can be a database, saved table, query, or relationship (Microsoft Access database engine databases only).


## Remarks

Each  **Container** object has a **Documents** collection containing **Document** objects that describe instances of built-in objects of the type specified by the **Container**. The following table lists the type of object each **Document** describes, the name of its **Container** object, and what type of information **Document** contains.



|**Document**|**Container**|**Contains information about**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Database|Databases|Saved database|
|Table or query|Tables|Saved table or query|
|Relationship|Relations|Saved relationship|



 **Note**  Don't confuse the  **Container** objects listed in the preceding table with the collections of the same name. The Databases **Container** object refers to all saved database objects, but the **Databases** collection refers only to database objects that are open in a particular workspace.

With a  **Document** object, you can:




- Use the  **Name** property to return the name that a user or the Microsoft Access database engine gave to the object when it was created.
    
- Use the  **Container** property to return the name of the **Container** object that contains the **Document** object.
    
- Use the  **Owner** property to set or return the owner of the object. To set the **Owner** property, you must have write permission for the **Document** object, and you must set the property to the name of an existing **User** or **Group** object.
    
- Use the  **UserName** or **Permissions** properties to set or return the access permissions of a user or group for the object. To set these properties, you must have write permission for the **Document** object, and you must set the **UserName** property to the name of an existing **User** or **Group** object.
    
- Use the  **DateCreated** and **LastUpdated** properties to return the date and time when the **Document** object was created and last modified.
    


Because a  **Document** object corresponds to an existing object, you can't create new **Document** objects or delete existing ones. To refer to a **Document** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:


-  **Documents** (0)
    
-  **Documents** (" _name_ ")
    
-  **Documents** ![ _name_ ]
    

## Example

This example enumerates the  **Documents** collection of the Tables container, and then enumerates the **Properties** collection of the first **Document** object in the collection.


```
Sub DocumentX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim docLoop As Document 
 Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 With dbsNorthwind.Containers!Tables 
 Debug.Print "Documents in " &amp; .Name &amp; " container" 
 ' Enumerate the Documents collection of the Tables 
 ' container. 
 For Each docLoop In .Documents 
 Debug.Print " " &amp; docLoop.Name 
 Next docLoop 
 With .Documents(0) 
 ' Enumerate the Properties collection of the first. 
 ' Document object of the Tables container. 
 Debug.Print "Properties of " &amp; .Name &amp; " document" 
 On Error Resume Next 
 For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
 Debug.Print " " &amp; prpLoop.Name &amp; " = " &amp; _ 
 prpLoop 
 Next prpLoop 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 End With 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 

```

This example uses the  **Owner** and **SystemDB** properties to show the owners of a variety of **Document** objects.




```
Sub OwnerX() 
 
 ' Ensure that the Microsoft Access workgroup file is 
 ' available. 
 DBEngine.SystemDB = "system.mdw" 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim ctrLoop As Container 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 With dbsNorthwind 
 Debug.Print "Document owners:" 
 ' Enumerate Containers collection and show the owner 
 ' of the first Document in each container's Documents 
 ' collection. 
 For Each ctrLoop In .Containers 
 With ctrLoop 
 Debug.Print " [" &amp; .Documents(0).Name &amp; _ 
 "] in [" &amp; .Name &amp; _ 
 "] container owned by [" &amp; _ 
 .Documents(0).Owner &amp; "]" 
 End With 
 Next ctrLoop 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
End Sub 
 

```
