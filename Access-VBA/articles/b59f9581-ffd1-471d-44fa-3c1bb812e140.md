# Count Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the number of objects in a collection.

## Return Value

Returns a  **Long** value.


## Remarks

Use the  **Count** property to determine how many objects are in a given collection.

Because numbering for members of a collection begins with zero, you should always code loops starting with the zero member and ending with the value of the  **Count** property minus 1. If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic and want to loop through the members of a collection without checking the **Count** property, use the **For** **Each...Next** command.

If the  **Count** property is zero, there are no objects in the collection.
