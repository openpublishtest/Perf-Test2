# Wait For Post Processing

You can use the  **Wait For Post Processing** property to specify that the form waits until processing of any operations (for example, running a macro) triggered by a user change to form data is complete before proceeding with the next operation.


## Setting

The  **Wait For Post Processing** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Yes**|Wait until processing of any operations triggered by a user change to form data is complete before proceeding with the next operation.|
|**No**|(Default) Does not wait until processing of any operations triggered by a user change to form data is complete before proceeding with the next operation.|

## Remarks

This property is designed to work with Access 2010 web databases only. When this property is set to  **Yes**, if a user changes data in a form that then triggers a data macro, the form will wait for the macro to finish before proceeding.
