Closes an open  **Database**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Close**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Database** object.


## Remarks

If the  **Database** object is already closed when you use **Close**, a run-time error occurs.

An alternative to the  **Close** method is to set the value of an object variable to **Nothing** ( `Set dbsTemp = Nothing`).
