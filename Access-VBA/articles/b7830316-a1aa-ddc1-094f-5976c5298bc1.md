# TextBox.EnterKeyBehavior Property (Access)

You can use the  **EnterKeyBehavior** property to specify what happens when you press ENTER in a text box control in Form view or Datasheet view. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **EnterKeyBehavior**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TextBox** object.


## Remarks

For example, you can use this property if you have a control bound to a Memo field in a table to make entering multiple-line text easier. If you don't set this property to New Line In Field, you must press CTRL+ENTER to enter a new line in the text box.

You can also set the default for this property by setting a control's  **DefaultControl** property in Visual Basic.
