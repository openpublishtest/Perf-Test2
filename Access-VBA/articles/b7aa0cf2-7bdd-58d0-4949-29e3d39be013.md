# Reference.Major Property (Access)

The  **Major** property of a **[Reference](87853230-294e-7ab8-4aae-78b094b5e584.md)** object returns a read-only **Long** value indicating the major version number of an application to which you have set a reference.


## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Reference** object.


## Remarks

Dim strInfo As String 
 
For Each r In Application.References 
 strInfo = strInfo &amp; r.Name &amp; " " &amp; r.Major &amp; "." &amp; r.Minor &amp; vbCrLf 
Next 
 
 
MsgBox "Current References: " &amp; vbCrLf &amp; strInfo
