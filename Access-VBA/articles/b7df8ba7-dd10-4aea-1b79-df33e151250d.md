## Remarks

 This event does not apply to a label attached to another control, such as the label for a text box. It applies only to "freestanding" labels. Pressing and releasing a mouse button in an attached label has the same effect as pressing and releasing the button in the associated control. The normal events for the control occur; no separate events occur for the attached label.

To run a macro or event procedure when these events occur, set the  **OnMouseMove** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

The  **MouseMove** event is generated continually as the mouse pointer moves over objects. Unless another object generates a mouse event, an object recognizes a **MouseMove** event whenever the mouse pointer is positioned within its borders.

To cause a  **MouseMove** event for a report to occur, press the mouse button in a blank area on the report. To cause a **MouseMove** event for a report section to occur, press the mouse button in a blank area of the report section.


 **Note**  

To run a macro or event procedure in response to pressing and releasing the mouse buttons, you use the  **MouseDown** and **MouseUp** events.
