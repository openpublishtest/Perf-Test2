# Calculate and Display Specific Date Values

Because a Date value is stored as a double-precision number, you may receive incorrect formatting results when you try to manipulate Date values in an expression. This topic illustrates how to create expressions and custom functions for displaying specific dates and calculating time intervals. 


## Displaying Specific Dates

The current month: 


```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Month(Date()), 1)
```

The next month: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Month(Date()) + 1, 1)
```

The last day of the current month: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Month(Date()) + 1, 0)
```

The last day of the next month: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Month(Date()) + 2, 0)
```

The first day of the previous month: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Month(Date())-1,1)
```

The last day of the previous month: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Month(Date()),0)
```

The first day of the current quarter: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Int((Month(Date()) - 1) / 3) * 3 + 1, 1)
```

The last day of the current quarter: 




```
DateSerial(Year(Date()), Int((Month(Date()) - 1) / 3) * 3 + 4, 0)
```

The first day of the current week (assuming Sunday = day 1):




```
Date() - WeekDay(Date()) + 1
```

The last day of the current week: 




```
Date() - WeekDay(Date()) + 7
```
