# Cannot make the <name> object in <name> container replicable. (Error 3583)

An object (table, form, report, module, macro) in the indicated container cannot be made replicable.

An example of an object that cannot be made replicable is a table that has 253 or more fields. Since replication needs to add a minumum of 3 additional fields, this would exceed the 255 field limit.
