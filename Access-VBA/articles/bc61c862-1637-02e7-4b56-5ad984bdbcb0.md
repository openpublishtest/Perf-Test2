# Users Collection (ADOX)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Contains all stored [User](e88b9a8a-e70f-c7ca-cb8c-bd274ff24948.md) objects of a catalog or group.

## Remarks

The  **Users** collection of a[Catalog](d9e8d94b-9161-3eb6-abaf-00d1244d1f2d.md) represents all the catalog's users. The **Users** collection for a[Group](91cf1b87-c928-1d89-2731-138f6299cc60.md) represents only the users that have a membership in the specific group.

The [Append](b7a1128b-c6e7-2071-c914-913b6bd245ae.md) method for a **Users** collection is unique for ADOX. You can:


- Add a new user to the collection with the  **Append** method.
    
The remaining properties and methods are standard to ADO collections. You can:


- Access a user in the collection with the [Item](793c305f-0e5b-a529-e21f-b7ab0843ed49.md) property.
    
- Return the number of users contained in the collection with the [Count](b59f9581-ffd1-471d-44fa-3c1bb812e140.md) property.
    
- Remove a user from the collection with the [Delete](bcf9b8dd-cc7a-c1f9-fd93-58694766c4d9.md) method.
    
- Update the objects in the collection to reflect the current database's schema with the [Refresh](f1c8829f-9c7d-12b6-7470-727ff38d663e.md) method.
    

 **Note**  Before appending a  **User** object to the **Users** collection of a **Group** object, a **User** object with the same[Name](c92a3b2b-6e3f-1ed9-c7be-bf348a0737af.md) as the one to be appended must already exist in the **Users** collection of the **Catalog**.
