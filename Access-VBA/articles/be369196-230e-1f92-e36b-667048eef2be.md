# ForEachRecord Data Block

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **ForEachRecord** data block repeats a set of statements for each record in a domain.


 **Note**  The  **ForEachRecord** data block is available only in Data Macros.


## Setting

The  **ForEachRecord** action has the following arguments.



|**Argument**|**Required**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**In**|Yes|A string that identifies the domain of records to operate on. The  _In_ argument can contain the name of the table, a select query, or a SQL statement.
 **Note**  The specified domain cannot include data stored in a linked table or ODBC data source.

|
|**Where Condition**|No|A string expression used to restrict the range of data on which the  **ForEachRecord** data block is performed. For example, criteria is often equivalent to the WHERE clause in an SQL expression, without the word WHERE. If criteria is omitted, the **ForEachRecord** data block operates on the entire domain specified by the _In_ argument. Any field that is included in criteria must also be a field in _In_.|
|**Alias**|No|A string that provides an alternative name for the domain specified by the  _In_ argument. Often used to shorten the table name for subsequent references to prevent possible ambiguous references.If _Alias_ is not specified, the table or query name will be used as the alias.|

## Remarks

Use the  **[ExitForEachRecord](22b28cac-6339-1d91-a73d-3b9da465f9fe.md)** action to exit a **ForEachRecord** data block immediately.
