 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Uniquely identifies a cell by its position within a cellset.

## Return Values

Returns a  **Long** integer and is read-only.


## Remarks

The cell's ordinal value uniquely identifies the cell within a cellset. Conceptually, cells are numbered in a cellset as if the cellset were a  _p_ -dimensional array, where _p_ is the number of[axes](7c719197-45f1-a5b9-665d-25cb693b1eb0.md). Cells are numbered starting from zero in row-major order. 

The cell's ordinal value can be used with the [Item](47510643-47af-0bfd-dc1f-ab984057bcd3.md) property of the[Cellset](28d4b3b9-f907-9ec0-00e1-9666c887cdf0.md) object to quickly retrieve the[Cell](b9d00b71-1f40-5bd1-4b89-fbdb59c552ba.md).
