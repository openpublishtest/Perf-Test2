## Syntax

 _expression_. **StatusBarText**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **EmptyCell** object.

 **Note**  The length of the text you can display in the status bar depends on your computer hardware and video display.

 **Note**  You can also use the  **ControlTipText** property to display a ScreenTip for a control.

## Example

The following example sets the status bar text to be displayed when the "Address_TextBox" control in the "Mailing List" form has the focus in Form View. 


```
Forms("Mailing List").Controls("Address_TextBox"). _ 
 StatusBarText = "Enter the company's mailing address."
