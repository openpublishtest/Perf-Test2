If a string expression, the _var_ argument must be the name of a member of the collection.|

The  **Item** method is the default member of the **References** collection, so you don't have to specify it explicitly. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent:




```
Debug.Print References(1).Name
```




```
Debug.Print References.Item(1).Name
```
