# Cannot change field <name>. (Error 3720)

This error occurs when trying to change a name or definition of a primary key that is referenced by other foreign keys. To change the definition or name of the columns participating in the primary key, you must first remove all foreign key references to the primary key. This typically happens when using the ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN statement.
