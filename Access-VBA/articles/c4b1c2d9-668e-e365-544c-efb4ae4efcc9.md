Sets or returns a bookmark that uniquely identifies the current record in a  **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Bookmark**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

For a  **Recordset** object based entirely on Microsoft Access database engine tables, the value of the **Bookmarkable** property is _True_, and you can use the  **Bookmark** property with that **Recordset**. Other database products may not support bookmarks, however. For example, you can't use bookmarks in any **Recordset** object based on a linked Paradox table that has no primary key.

When you create or open a  **Recordset** object, each of its records already has a unique bookmark. You can save the bookmark for the current record by assigning the value of the **Bookmark** property to a variable. To quickly return to that record at any time after moving to a different record, set the **Recordset** object's **Bookmark** property to the value of that variable.

There is no limit to the number of bookmarks you can establish. To create a bookmark for a record other than the current record, move to the desired record and assign the value of the  **Bookmark** property to a **String** variable that identifies the record.

To make sure the  **Recordset** object supports bookmarks, check the value of its **[Bookmarkable](6323f162-75c4-7cfe-c918-0b9454560f97.md)** property before you use the **Bookmark** property. If the **Bookmarkable** property is _False_, the  **Recordset** object doesn't support bookmarks, and using the **Bookmark** property results in a trappable error.

If you use the  **[Clone](50cbc011-7e72-4dee-488d-96e681618e8e.md)** method to create a copy of a **Recordset** object, the **Bookmark** property settings for the original and the duplicate **Recordset** objects are identical and can be used interchangeably. However, you can't use bookmarks from different **Recordset** objects interchangeably, even if they were created by using the same object or the same SQL statement.

If you set the  **Bookmark** property to a value that represents a deleted record, a trappable error occurs.

The value of the  **Bookmark** property isn't the same as a record number.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **Bookmark** and **Bookmarkable** properties to let the user flag a record in a **Recordset** and return to it later.


```
Sub BookmarkX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstCategories As Recordset 
 Dim strMessage As String 
 Dim intCommand As Integer 
 Dim varBookmark As Variant 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstCategories = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Categories", _ 
 dbOpenSnapshot) 
 
 With rstCategories 
 
 If .Bookmarkable = False Then 
 Debug.Print "Recordset is not Bookmarkable!" 
 Else 
 ' Populate Recordset. 
 .MoveLast 
 .MoveFirst 
 
 Do While True 
 ' Show information about current record and get 
 ' user input. 
 strMessage = "Category: " &amp; !CategoryName &amp; _ 
 " (record " &amp; (.AbsolutePosition + 1) &amp; _ 
 " of " &amp; .RecordCount &amp; ")" &amp; vbCr &amp; _ 
 "Enter command:" &amp; vbCr &amp; _ 
 "[1 - next / 2 - previous /" &amp; vbCr &amp; _ 
 "3 - set bookmark / 4 - go to bookmark]" 
 intCommand = Val(InputBox(strMessage)) 
 
 Select Case intCommand 
 ' Move forward or backward, trapping for BOF 
 ' or EOF. 
 Case 1 
 .MoveNext 
 If .EOF Then .MoveLast 
 Case 2 
 .MovePrevious 
 If .BOF Then .MoveFirst 
 
 ' Store the bookmark of the current record. 
 Case 3 
 varBookmark = .Bookmark 
 
 ' Go to the record indicated by the stored 
 ' bookmark. 
 Case 4 
 If IsEmpty(varBookmark) Then 
 MsgBox "No Bookmark set!" 
 Else 
 .Bookmark = varBookmark 
 End If 
 
 Case Else 
 Exit Do 
 End Select 
 
 Loop 
 
 End If 
 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 

```

This example uses the  **LastModified** property to move the current record pointer to both a record that has been modified and a newly created record.




```
Sub LastModifiedX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
 Dim strFirst As String 
 Dim strLast As String 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set rstEmployees = _ 
 dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
 dbOpenDynaset) 
 
 With rstEmployees 
 ' Store current data. 
 strFirst = !FirstName 
 strLast = !LastName 
 ' Change data in current record. 
 .Edit 
 !FirstName = "Julie" 
 !LastName = "Warren" 
 .Update 
 ' Move current record pointer to the most recently 
 ' changed or added record. 
 .Bookmark = .LastModified 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "Data in LastModified record after Edit: " &amp; _ 
 !FirstName &amp; " " &amp; !LastName 
 
 ' Restore original data because this is a demonstration. 
 .Edit 
 !FirstName = strFirst 
 !LastName = strLast 
 .Update 
 
 ' Add new record. 
 .AddNew 
 !FirstName = "Roger" 
 !LastName = "Harui" 
 .Update 
 ' Move current record pointer to the most recently 
 ' changed or added record. 
 .Bookmark = .LastModified 
 Debug.Print _ 
 "Data in LastModified record after AddNew: " &amp; _ 
 !FirstName &amp; " " &amp; !LastName 
 
 ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
 .Delete 
 .Close 
 End With 
 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 

```
