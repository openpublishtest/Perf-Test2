# CloseDatabase Macro Action

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

You can use the  **CloseDatabase** action to close the current database.


## Setting

The  **CloseDatabase** action does not have any arguments.


## Remarks


- Access will not run any actions that follow the  **CloseDatabase** action in a macro.
    
- This action has the same effect as clicking the  **File**tab and then clicking  **Close Database**. If there are any unsaved objects open when you run the  **CloseDatabase** action, the dialog boxes that appear are the same as those displayed when you click **Close Database**.
    
- To run the  **CloseDatabase** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **CloseDatabase** method of the **DoCmd** object.
