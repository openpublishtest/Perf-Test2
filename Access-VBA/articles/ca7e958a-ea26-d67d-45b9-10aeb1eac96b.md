If your application cannot work correctly with the default functionality of the Microsoft Access database engine, you may have to change the settings in the Microsoft® Windows® Registry to suit your needs. The Windows Registry can also be used to tune the operation of the installable ISAM and ODBC driver.

You can customize the settings in the Windows Registry in four different ways:
[Using Regedit.exe to Overwrite the Default Settings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4737dcbe-d4c2-9cbe-4703-e4a9874d50a9%28Office.15%29.aspx)
