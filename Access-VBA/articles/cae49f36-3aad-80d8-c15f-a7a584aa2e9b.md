 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_





## Syntax

 _expression_. **Cancel**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **Recordset2** object.


## Remarks

Use the  **Cancel** method to terminate execution of an asynchronous **Execute** or **OpenConnection** method call (that is, the method was invoked with the _dbRunAsync_ option). **Cancel** will return a run-time error if _dbRunAsync_ was not used in the method you're trying to terminate.
