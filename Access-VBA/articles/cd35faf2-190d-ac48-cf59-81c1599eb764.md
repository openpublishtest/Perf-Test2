You can use the  **OpenReport** action to open a report in Design view or Print Preview, or to send the report directly to the printer. You can also restrict the records that are printed in the report.

## Setting
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

The  **OpenReport** action has the following arguments.



|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _Report Name_|The name of the report to open. The  **Report Name** box in the **Action Arguments** section of the **Macro Builder** pane shows all reports in the current database. This is a required argument. If you run a macro containing the **OpenReport** action in a library database, Microsoft Access first looks for the report with this name in the library database, and then in the current database.|
| _View_|The view in which the report will open. Click  **Print** (print the report immediately), **Design**, or  **Print Preview** in the **View** box. The default is **Print**.|
| _Filter Name_|A filter that restricts the report's records. You can enter the name of either an existing query or a filter that was saved as a query. However, the query must include all the fields in the report you are opening or have its  **OutputAllFields** property set to **Yes**.|
| _Where Condition_|A valid SQL WHERE clause (without the word WHERE) or expression that Access uses to select records from the report's underlying table or query. If you select a filter with the  _Filter Name_ argument, Access applies this WHERE clause to the results of the filter. To open a report and restrict its records to those specified by the value of a control on a form, use the following expression: **[** _fieldname_ **] = Forms![** _formname_ **]![** _controlname on form_ **]** Replace _fieldname_ with the name of a field in the underlying table or query of the report you want to open. Replace _formname_ and _controlname on form_ with the name of the form and the control on the form that contains the value you want records in the report to match.
 **Note**  The maximum length of the  _Where Condition_ argument is 255 characters. If you need to enter a more complex SQL WHERE clause longer than this, use the **OpenReport** method of the **DoCmd** object in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module instead. You can enter SQL WHERE clause statements of up to 32,768 characters in VBA.

|
| _Window Mode_| The mode in which the report will open. Click **Normal**,  **Hidden**,  **Icon**, or  **Dialog** in the **Window Mode** box. The default is **Normal**.
 **Note**  Some  _Window Mode_ argument settings do not apply when using tabbed documents. To switch to overlapping windows:


<ol xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mtps="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/mtps" xmlns:mshelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" xmlns:ddue="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><li><p> and then click <span class="ui">Options</span>.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="ui">Access Options</span> dialog box, click <span class="ui">Current Database</span>.</p></li><li><p>In the <span class="ui">Application Options</span> section, under <span class="ui">Document Window Options</span>, click <span class="ui">Overlapping Windows</span>.</p></li><li><p>Click <span class="ui">OK</span>, then close and reopen the database.</p></li></ol>|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The  **Print** setting for the **View** argument prints the report immediately by using the current printer settings, without bringing up the **Print** dialog box. You can also use the **OpenReport** action to open and set up a report and then use the **PrintOut** action to print it. For example, you may want to modify the report or use the **PrintOut** action to change the printer settings before you print.

The filter and WHERE condition you apply become the setting of the report's  **Filter** property.

The  **OpenReport** action is similar to double-clicking the report in the Navigation Pane, or right-clicking the report in the Navigation Pane and selecting a view or the **Print** command.

 **Tips**


- To print similar reports for different sets of data, use a filter or a WHERE clause to restrict the records printed in the report. Then edit the macro to apply a different filter or change the  _Where Condition_ argument.
    
- You can drag a report from the Navigation Pane to a macro action row. This automatically creates an  **OpenReport** action that opens the report in Report view.
    

## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

The following example shows how to use the  **OpenReport** action to pass a parameter that filters a report as it is opened. The **rptChapters** report displays the records for the specified author by passing the item selected in the **cboAuthors** combo box to the _SelectedAuthor_ parameter.
