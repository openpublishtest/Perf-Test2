 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

 **In this article**
[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Returns a 16-byte value that uniquely identifies a database replica (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **ReplicaID**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Database** object.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

The return value is a  **GUID** value that uniquely identifies the replica or Design Master.

The Microsoft Access database engine automatically generates this value when you create a new replica.

The  **ReplicaID** property of each replica (and the Design Master) is stored in the MSysReplicas system table.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example makes a replica from the Design Master of Northwind.mdb, and then returns the replica's  **ReplicaID**, which is automatically created by the Microsoft Access database engine. (If you have not yet created a Design Master of Northwind, refer to the **Replicable** property, or change the name of the database in the code to an existing Design Master.)


```
Sub MakeReplicaReplicaIDX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim prpReplicaID As Property 
 Dim dbsReplica As Database 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 ' Makes a new replica. 
 dbsNorthwind.MakeReplica "Nwreplica2.mdb", _ 
 "second replica" 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
 ' Opens the new replica to read its ReplicaID. 
 Set dbsReplica = OpenDatabase("Nwreplica2.mdb") 
 
 Debug.Print dbsReplica.ReplicaID 
 dbsReplica.Close 
 
End Sub 
 

```
