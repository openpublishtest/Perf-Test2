# Suspend Code Execution Until a Pop-up Form is Closed

To ensure that code in a form suspends operation until a pop-up form is closed, you must open the pop-up form as a modalwindow. The following example illustrates how to use the  **[OpenForm](A1C9D3A9-2AF8-C30A-ACB0-6428C70DCDB0.md)** method to do this.


```
doCmd.OpenForm FormName:=<Name of form to open>, WindowMode:=acDialog
```
