 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates how many records constitute one page in the [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md).

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a  **Long** value that indicates how many records are on a page. The default is 10.


## Remarks

Use the  **PageSize** property to determine how many records make up a logical page of data. Establishing a page size allows you to use the[AbsolutePage](b6e5daac-cc21-0aa6-9119-a973595762bb.md) property to move to the first record of a particular page. This is useful in Web server scenarios when you want to allow the user to page through data, viewing a certain number of records at a time.

This property can be set at any time, and its value will be used for calculating the location of the first record of a particular page.
