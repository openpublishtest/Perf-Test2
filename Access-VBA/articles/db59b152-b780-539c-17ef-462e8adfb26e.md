# Accessing Rows in a Hierarchical Recordset

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

The following example shows the steps necessary to access rows in a hierarchical [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md):


1.  **Recordset** objects from the authors and titleauthor tables are related by author ID.
    
2. The outer loop displays each author's first and last name, state, and identification.
    
3. The appended  **Recordset** for each row is retrieved from the **Fields** collection and assigned to _rstTitleAuthor_.
    
4. The inner loop displays four fields from each row in the appended  **Recordset**.
    
(The [StayInSync](02c95c10-4032-14e1-e506-f334a8787142.md) property is set to FALSE for purposes of illustration â€” so you can see the chapter change explicitly in each iteration of the outer loop. However, the example will be more efficient if the assignment in step 3 is moved before the first line in step 2, so that the assignment is performed only once. Then set the **StayInSync** property to TRUE, so that _rstTitleAuthor_ will implicitly and automatically change to the corresponding chapter whenever _rst_ moves to a new row.)
 **Example**



```
 
Sub datashape() 
 Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection 
 Dim rst As New ADODB.Recordset 
 Dim rstTitleAuthor As New ADODB.Recordset 
 
 cnn.Provider = "MSDataShape" 
 cnn.Open "Data Provider=MSDASQL;" &amp; _ 
 "Data Source=SRV;" &amp; _ 
 "User Id=MyUserName;Password=MyPassword;Database=Pubs" 
' STEP 1 
 rst.StayInSync = FALSE 
 rst.Open "SHAPE {select * from authors} " &amp; _ 
 "APPEND ({select * from titleauthor} " &amp; _ 
 "RELATE au_id TO au_id) AS chapTitleAuthor", _ 
 cnn 
' STEP 2 
 While Not rst.EOF 
 Debug.Print rst("au_fname"), rst("au_lname"), _ 
 rst("state"), rst("au_id") 
' STEP 3 
 Set rstTitleAuthor = rst("chapTitleAuthor").Value 
' STEP 4 
 While Not rstTitleAuthor.EOF 
 Debug.Print rstTitleAuthor(0), rstTitleAuthor(1), _ 
 rstTitleAuthor(2), rstTitleAuthor(3) 
 rstTitleAuthor.MoveNext 
 Wend 
 rst.MoveNext 
 Wend 
End Sub 

```
