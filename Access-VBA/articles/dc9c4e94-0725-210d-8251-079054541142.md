# MarshalOptions Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates which records are to be marshaled back to the server.

## Settings And Return Values

Sets or returns a [MarshalOptionsEnum](5361884b-a0fe-c480-1b9f-18e53be77f86.md) value. The default value is **adMarshalAll**.


## Remarks

When using a client-side [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md), records that have been modified on the client are written back to the middle tier or Web server through a technique called marshaling, the process of packaging and sending interface method parameters across thread or process boundaries. Setting the  **MarshalOptions** property can improve performance when modified remote data is marshaled for updating back to the middle tier or Web server.

 **Remote Data Service Usage** This property is used only on a client-side **Recordset**.
