# You tried to lock table <table> while opening it, but the table cannot be locked because it is currently in use. Wait a moment, and then try the operation again. (Error 3009)

Either another user has an exclusive lock on the table that you are trying to access in a shared mode or another user has a shared lock on the table that you are trying to open exclusively. The user name that is returned will show who currently has the lock.
