[Syntax](#sectionSection0)
[Remarks](#sectionSection1)
[Example](#sectionSection2)


Moves the position of the current record in a  **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **Move**( ** _Rows_**, ** _StartBookmark_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Rows_|Required|**Long**|The number of rows the position will move. If rows is greater than 0, the position is moved forward (toward the end of the file). If rows is less than 0, the position is moved backward (toward the beginning of the file).|
| _StartBookmark_|Optional|**Variant**|A value identifying a bookmark. If you specify startbookmark, the move begins relative to this bookmark. Otherwise, Move begins from the current record.|

## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

If you use  **Move** to position the current record pointer before the first record, the current record pointer moves to the beginning of the file. If the **Recordset** contains no records and its **[BOF](d97d0507-0d5a-e3f1-fa30-40caec9f3ffa.md)** property is **True**, using this method to move backward causes an error.

If you use  **Move** to position the current record pointer after the last record, the current record pointer position moves to the end of the file. If the **Recordset** contains no records and its **[EOF](9d4e1ee2-e866-3ebf-e08b-b31b0cb47ed9.md)** property is **True**, then using this method to move forward causes an error.

If either the  **BOF** or **EOF** property is **True** and you attempt to use the **Move** method without a valid bookmark, a run-time error occurs.


 **Note**  


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **Move** method to position the record pointer based on user input.
