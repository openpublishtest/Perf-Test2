# Duplicate output alias <name>. (Error 3062)

You tried to execute an SQL statement that has more than one alias with the same name. The following statement, for example, would produce this error:


```
SELECT LastName AS Name, FirstName AS Name FROM Employees;

```


Rename one or more of the aliases, and then try the operation again.
