# TabControl.Change Event (Access)

The  **Change** event occurs when when you move from one page to another page.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Change**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TabControl** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  Setting the value of a control by using a macro or Visual Basic doesn't trigger this event for the control. You must type the data directly into the control, or set the control's  **Text** property.

To run a macro or event procedure when this event occurs, set the  **OnChange** property to the name of the macro or to [Event Procedure].

By running a macro or event procedure when a Change event occurs, you can coordinate data display among controls. You can also display data or a formula in one control and the results in another control.

 **KeyDown** → **KeyPress** → **BeforeInsert** → **Change** → **KeyUp**
