Retrieves multiple rows from a  **[Recordset](9774232c-e6da-175b-fc7f-ed2ab7908fa0.md)** object.

## Syntax
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 _expression_. **GetRows**( ** _NumRows_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _NumRows_|Optional|**Variant**|The number of rows to retrieve.|

### Return Value

Variant


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Use the  **GetRows** method to copy records from a **Recordset**. **GetRows** returns a two-dimensional array. The first subscript identifies the field and the second identifies the row number. For example, `intField` represents the field, and `intRecord` identifies the row number:

 `avarRecords(intField, intRecord)`

To get the first field value in the second row returned, use code like the following:

 `field1 = avarRecords(0,1)`

To get the second field value in the first row, use code like the following:

 `field2 = avarRecords(1,0)`

The  `avarRecords` variable automatically becomes a two-dimensional array when **GetRows** returns data.

If you request more rows than are available, then  **GetRows** returns only the number of available rows. You can use the Visual Basic for Applications **UBound** function to determine how many rows **GetRows** actually retrieved, because the array is sized to fit the number of returned rows. For example, if you returned the results into a **Variant** called `varA`, you could use the following code to determine how many rows were actually returned:

 `numReturned = UBound(varA,2) + 1`

You need to use  `"+ 1"` because the first row returned is in the 0 element of the array. The number of rows that you can retrieve is constrained by the amount of available memory. You shouldn't use **GetRows** to retrieve an entire table into an array if it is large.

Because  **GetRows** returns all fields of the **Recordset** into the array, including Memo and Long Binary fields, you might want to use a query that restricts the fields returned.

After you call  **GetRows**, the current record is positioned at the next unread row. That is, **GetRows** has the same effect on the current record as **Move** _numrows_.

If you are trying to retrieve all the rows by using multiple  **GetRows** calls, use the **[EOF](9d4e1ee2-e866-3ebf-e08b-b31b0cb47ed9.md)** property to be sure that you're at the end of the **Recordset**. **GetRows** returns less than the number requested if it's at the end of the **Recordset**, or if it can't retrieve a row in the range requested. For example, if you're trying to retrieve 10 records, but you can't retrieve the fifth record, **GetRows** returns four records and makes the fifth record the current record. This will not generate a run-time error. This might occur if another user deletes a record in a dynaset-type **Recordset**. See the example for a demonstration of how to handle this.


## Example
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

This example uses the  **GetRows** method to retrieve a specified number of rows from a **Recordset** and to fill an array with the resulting data. The **GetRows** method will return fewer than the desired number of rows in two cases: either if **EOF** has been reached, or if **GetRows** tried to retrieve a record that was deleted by another user. The function returns **False** only if the second case occurs. The GetRowsOK function is required for this procedure to run.
