# Cannot create relationship. Referenced table <name> does not have a primary key. (Error 3373)

The table you have referenced in the CONSTRAINT clause does not have a primary key. To create the relationship, you must either create a primary key in the referenced table, or specifically reference one or more uniquely indexed fields to use in the relationship.
