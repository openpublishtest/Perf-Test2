# CurrentProject Object (Access)

The  **CurrentProject** object refers to the project for the current Microsoft Access project (.adp) or Access database.


## Remarks

The  **CurrentProject** object has several collections that contain specific **[AccessObject](8a770b33-5bff-120a-6707-ca214ee5ced3.md)** objects within the current database. The following table lists the name of each collection and the types of objects it contains.



|**Collections**|**Object type**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**[AllForms](b90616b9-90fc-bb51-6bfa-b149dece0f1b.md)**|All forms|
|**[AllReports](5846cf60-41b4-e9f8-ea27-b9400a6d3861.md)**|All reports|
|**[AllMacros](a36ba978-f643-aca6-5efb-842723d17bbc.md)**|All macros|
|**[AllModules](322815ae-3afd-f299-0ce9-2e9dbbb8536a.md)**|All modules|

 **Note**  The collections in the preceding table contain all of the respective objects in the database regardless if they are opened or closed.

For example, an  **AccessObject** object representing a form is a member of the **AllForms** collection, which is a collection of **AccessObject** objects within the current database. Within the **AllForms** collection, individual members of the collection are indexed beginning with zero. You can refer to an individual **AccessObject** object in the **AllForms** collection either by referring to the form by name, or by referring to its index within the collection. If you want to refer to a specific object in the **AllForms** collection, it's better to refer to it by name because a item's collection index may change. If the object name includes a space, the name must be surrounded by brackets ([ ]).



|**Syntax**|**Example**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**AllForms** ! _formname_|AllForms!OrderForm|
|**AllForms** ![ _form name_]|AllForms![Order Form]|
|**AllForms** (" _formname_")|AllForms("OrderForm")|
|**AllForms** ( _formname_)|AllForms(0)|

## Example

The following example prints some current property settings of the  **CurrentProject** object and then sets an option to display hidden objects within the application:


```
Sub ApplicationInformation() 
 ' Print name and type of current object. 
 Debug.Print Application.CurrentProject.FullName 
 Debug.Print Application.CurrentProject.ProjectType 
 ' Set Hidden Objects option under Show on View Tab 
 'of the Options dialog box. 
 Application.SetOption "Show Hidden Objects", True 
End Sub
```

The next example shows how to use the CurrentProject object using Automation from another Microsoft Office application. First, from the other application, create a reference to Microsoft Access by clicking  **References** on the **Tools** menu in the Module window. Select the check box next to **Microsoft Access Object Library**. Then enter the following code in a Visual Basic module within that application and call the GetAccessData procedure.

The example passes a database name and report name to a procedure that creates a new instance of the  **Application** class, opens the database, and verifies that the specified report exists using the **CurrentProject** object and **AllReports** collection.




```
Sub GetAccessData() 
' Declare object variable in declarations section of a module 
 Dim appAccess As Access.Application 
 Dim strDB As String 
 Dim strReportName As String 
 
 strDB = "C:\Program Files\Microsoft "_ 
 &amp; "Office\Office11\Samples\Northwind.mdb" 
 strReportName = InputBox("Enter name of report to be verified", _ 
 "Report Verification") 
 VerifyAccessReport strDB, strReportName 
End Sub 
 
Sub VerifyAccessReport(strDB As String, _ 
 strReportName As String) 
 ' Return reference to Microsoft Access 
 ' Application object. 
 Set appAccess = New Access.Application 
 ' Open database in Microsoft Access. 
 appAccess.OpenCurrentDatabase strDB 
 ' Verify report exists. 
 On Error Goto ErrorHandler 
 appAccess.CurrentProject.AllReports(strReportName) 
 MsgBox "Report " &amp; strReportName &amp; _ 
 " verified within Northwind database." 
 appAccess.CloseCurrentDatabase 
 Set appAccess = Nothing 
Exit Sub 
ErrorHandler: 
 MsgBox "Report " &amp; strReportName &amp; _ 
 " does not exist within Northwind database." 
 appAccess.CloseCurrentDatabase 
 Set appAccess = Nothing 
End Sub
```
