## Step 2: Get the Data

In this step, you will write the code to open an ADO  **Recordset** and prepare to send it to the client. Open the file XMLResponse.asp with a text editor, such as Windows Notepad, and insert the following code:


```
 
<%@ language="VBScript" %> 
 
<!-- #include file='adovbs.inc' --> 
 
<% 
  Dim strSQL, strCon 
  Dim adoRec  
  Dim adoCon  
  Dim xmlDoc  
 
  ' You will need to change "slqServer" below to the name of the SQL  
  ' server machine to which you want to connect. 
  strCon = "Provider=sqloledb;Data Source=sqlServer;Initial Catalog=Pubs;Integrated Security=SSPI;" 
  Set adoCon = server.createObject("ADODB.Connection") 
  adoCon.Open strCon 
 
  strSQL = "SELECT Title, Price FROM Titles ORDER BY Price" 
  Set adoRec = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") 
  adoRec.Open strSQL, adoCon, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic, adCmdText 

```

Be sure to change the value of the  `Data Source` parameter in parameter in `strCon` to the name of your Microsoft SQL Server computer.

Keep the file open and go on to the next step.
