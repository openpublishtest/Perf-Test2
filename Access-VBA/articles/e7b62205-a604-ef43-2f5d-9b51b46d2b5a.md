# ReadyState Property (RDS)

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the progress of a [DataControl](ac430669-7628-696c-c036-b5d35405d788.md) object as it retrieves data into its[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns one of the following values.



|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**adcReadyStateLoaded**|The current query is still executing and no rows have been fetched. The  **DataControl** object's **Recordset** is not available for use.|
|**adcReadyStateInteractive**|An initial set of rows retrieved by the current query has been stored in the  **DataControl** object's **Recordset** and are available for use. The remaining rows are still being fetched.|
|**adcReadyStateComplete**|All rows retrieved by the current query have been stored in the  **DataControl** object's **Recordset** and are available for use. This state will also exist if an operation aborted due to an error, or if the **Recordset** object is not initialized.|

 **Note**  Each client-side executable file that uses these constants must provide declarations for them. You can cut and paste the constant declarations you want from the file Adcvbs.inc, located in the C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\MSADC folder.


## Remarks

Use the [onReadyStateChange](88102ee5-cca9-8ccb-5aca-55cda71abc4d.md) event to monitor changes in the **ReadyState** property during an asynchronous query operation. This is more efficient than periodically checking the value of the property.

If an error occurs during an asynchronous operation, the  **ReadyState** property changes to **adcReadyStateComplete**, the[State](ade0a50c-e2d8-23ac-4ea9-b012fedcd5db.md) property changes from **adStateExecuting** to **adStateClosed**, and the **Recordset** object[Value](ff21d122-98e3-2b48-d92f-e696b8079fc5.md) property remains _Nothing_.
