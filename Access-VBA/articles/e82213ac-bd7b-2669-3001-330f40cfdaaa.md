# Application.UserControl Property (Access)

You can use the  **UserControl** property to determine whether the current Microsoft Access application was started by the user or by another application with Automation, formerly called OLE Automation. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **UserControl**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


## Remarks

The  **UserControl** property uses the following settings.



|**Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**True**|The current application was started by the user.|
|**False**|The current application was started by another application with Automation.|
This property is read-only in all views when user starts the Access application. If Microsoft Access is started by OLE Automation, the  **UserControl** property can be set in Visual Basic.

When an application is launched by the user, the  **Visible** and **UserControl** properties of the **[Application](aefb0713-97e6-e2c7-e530-8fd2e1316a55.md)** object are both set to **True**. When the **UserControl** property is set to **True**, it isn't possible to set the **Visible** property of the object to **False**.

When an  **Application** object is created by using Automation, the **Visible** and **UserControl** properties of the object are both set to **False**.


## Example

The following example displays a message indicating whether Access was started by the user.


```
MsgBox "The user started Access:  " &amp; Application.UserControl
```
