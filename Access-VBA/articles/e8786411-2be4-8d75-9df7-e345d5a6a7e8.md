# Using the Connection Object (Access)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

A  **Connection** object represents a unique session with a data source. In the case of a client/server database system, it can be equivalent to an actual network connection to the server. Depending on the functionality supported by the provider, some collections, methods, or properties of a **Connection** object might not be available.

Before opening a  **Connection** object, you must define certain information about the data source and type of connection. The _ConnectionString_ parameter of the **Connection** object **Open** method — or the **ConnectionString** property on the **Connection** object — usually contains most of this information. A connection string is a string of characters that defines a variable number of arguments. The arguments — some required by ADO, but others provider-specific — contain information that the **Connection** object must have to carry out its work. The arguments that make up the _ConnectionString_ parameter are separated with semicolons (;).

 **Note**  You can also specify an ODBC Data Source Name (DSN) or a Data Link (UDL) file in a connection string. For more information about DSNs, see Data Sources in Part 1 of the  _ODBC Programmer's Reference_. For more information about UDLs, see Data Link API Overview in the _OLE DB Programmer's Reference_.
