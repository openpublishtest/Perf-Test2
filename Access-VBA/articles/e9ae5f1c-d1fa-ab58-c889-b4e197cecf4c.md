# Groups and Users Append, ChangePassword Methods Example (VB)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

This example demonstrates the [Append](c3245a24-55b8-3f3f-1c4a-43a119d84dc8.md) method of[Groups](9aec57df-bc5c-f9b3-5aec-e7e7efa47ba8.md), as well as the [Append](b7a1128b-c6e7-2071-c914-913b6bd245ae.md) method of[Users](bc61c862-1637-02e7-4b56-5ad984bdbcb0.md) by adding a new[Group](91cf1b87-c928-1d89-2731-138f6299cc60.md) and a new[User](e88b9a8a-e70f-c7ca-cb8c-bd274ff24948.md) to the system. The new **Group** is appended to the **Groups** collection of the new **User**. Consequently, the new **User** is added to the **Group**. Also, the[ChangePassword](999826a5-3e6b-b6da-b8f6-d61b9a50ceca.md) method is used to specify the **User** password.
