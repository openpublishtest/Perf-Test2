Data shaping typically requires two providers. The service provider, [Data Shaping Service for OLE DB](6e6e5f39-6f43-7c7b-5812-796096d1d31b.md), supplies the data shaping functionality, and a data provider, such as the OLE DB Provider for SQL Server, supplies rows of data to populate the shaped [Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md).

The name of the service provider (MSDataShape) can be specified as the value of the [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) object[Provider](1b795f51-93d7-431c-b1fe-0db95f69a56a.md) property or the connection string keyword "Provider=MSDataShape;".
The name of the data provider can be specified as the value of the  **Data Provider** dynamic property, which is added to the **Connection** object[Properties](4d662790-1252-c930-e6f9-edf6a38636af.md) collection by the Data Shaping Service for OLE DB, or the connection string keyword " **Data Provider=** _provider_ ".
No data provider is required if the  **Recordset** is not populated (for example, as in a fabricated **Recordset** where columns are created with the NEW keyword). In that case, specify " **Data Provider=** none;".

## Example


```
 
Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection 
cnn.Provider = "MSDataShape" 
cnn.Open "Data Provider=SQLOLEDB;Integrated Security=SSPI;Database=Northwind" 

```
