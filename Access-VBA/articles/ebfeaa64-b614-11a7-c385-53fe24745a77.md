 _expression_ A variable that represents a **NavigationButton** object.

The following example sets the status bar text to be displayed when the "Address_TextBox" control in the "Mailing List" form has the focus in Form View. 


```
Forms("Mailing List").Controls("Address_TextBox"). _ 
 StatusBarText = "Enter the company's mailing address."
