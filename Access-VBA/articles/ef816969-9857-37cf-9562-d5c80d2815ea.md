# Recordset2.Close Method (DAO)

Closes an open  **Recordset**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Close**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.


## Remarks

If the  **Recordset** object is already closed when you use **Close**, a run-time error occurs.

If you try to close a  **Connection** object while it has any open **Recordset** objects, the **Recordset** objects will be closed and any pending updates or edits will be canceled. Similarly, if you try to close a **Workspace** object while it has any open **Connection** objects, those **Connection** objects will be closed, which will close their **Recordset** objects.

An alternative to the  **Close** method is to set the value of an object variable to **Nothing** ( `Set dbsTemp = Nothing`).
