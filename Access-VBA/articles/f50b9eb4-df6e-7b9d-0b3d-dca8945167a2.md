# ADO Event Handler Summary

 **Last modified:** March 09, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

Two ADO objects can raise events: the [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) object and the[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object. The **ConnectionEvent** family pertains to operations on the **Connection** object, and the **RecordsetEvent** family pertains to operations on the **Recordset** object.


-  **Connection Events**: Events are issued when a transaction on a connection begins, is committed, or is rolled back; when a[Command](64f4ef03-f858-c004-b891-0c96d13a5e6e.md) executes; when a warning occurs during a **Connection Event** operation; or when a **Connection** starts or ends.
    
-  **Recordset Events**: Events are issued around asynchronous fetch operations as well as when you navigate through the rows of a **Recordset** object, change a field in a row of a **Recordset**, change a row in a **Recordset**, open a **Recordset** with a server-side cursor, close a **Recordset**, or make any change whatsoever in the **Recordset**.
    
The following tables summarize the events and their descriptions.
