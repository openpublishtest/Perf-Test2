# ODBC - update on a linked table <table> failed. (Error 3157)

Using an ODBC connection, you tried to update data in an ODBC database; that update could not be completed.

Possible causes:




- The update would have caused a rule violation.
    
- The ODBC database is read-only, or you do not have permission to update data in that database. Resolve the read-only condition, or see your system administrator or the person who created the database to obtain the necessary permissions.
    
- The ODBC database is on a network drive and the network is not connected. Make sure the network is available, and then try the operation again.
