## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Formatting strings are case-sensitive. Different formatting can be obtained by using a different case. For example, when formatting a date value with the string "D" you get the date in the long format (according to your current locale). However, if you change the case to "d" you get the date in the short format. Also, unexpected results or an error might occur if the intended formatting does not match the case of any defined format string.
