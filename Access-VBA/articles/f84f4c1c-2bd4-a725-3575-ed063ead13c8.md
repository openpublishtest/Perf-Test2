 **In this article**
[Return Value](#sectionSection1)
[Remarks](#sectionSection2)
[Record](#sectionSection3)



Indicates a [Field](1dbd535e-48ad-a5c8-a1b2-6776c1e3e19d.md) object's current value in the database.

## Return Value
<a name="sectionSection1"> </a>

Returns a  **Variant** value that indicates the value of the **Field**.


## Remarks
<a name="sectionSection2"> </a>

Use the  **UnderlyingValue** property to return the current field value from the database. The field value in the **UnderlyingValue** property is the value that is visible to your transaction and may be the result of a recent update by another transaction. This may differ from the[OriginalValue](02ffc728-4692-d439-e2a6-2f02cca53a71.md) property, which reflects the value that was originally returned to the[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md).

This is similar to using the [Resync](f594a200-56e6-fcf5-9b0a-900c56377f24.md) method, but the **UnderlyingValue** property returns only the value for a specific field from the current record. This is the same value that the[Resync](f594a200-56e6-fcf5-9b0a-900c56377f24.md) method uses to replace the[Value](ff21d122-98e3-2b48-d92f-e696b8079fc5.md) property.

When you use this property with the  **OriginalValue** property, you can resolve conflicts that arise from batch updates.


## Record
<a name="sectionSection3"> </a>

For [Record](817aaf13-78d4-1134-aa94-997e92077c22.md) objects, this property will be empty for fields added before[Update](fc88cab6-c379-bb4f-530c-da08107924e0.md) is called.
