# DataMember Property (ADO)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the name of the data member that will be retrieved from the object referenced by the [DataSource](5c5d6c9b-b7d4-45a5-0f6a-a5580a74361e.md) property.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a  **String** value. The name is not case sensitive.


## Remarks

This property is used to create data-bound controls with the Data Environment. The Data Environment maintains collections of data (data sources) containing named objects ( _data members_ ) that will be represented as a[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md) object _._

The  **DataMember** and **DataSource** properties must be used in conjunction.

The  **DataMember** property determines which object specified by the **DataSource** property will be represented as a **Recordset** object. The **Recordset** object must be closed before this property is set. An error is generated if the **DataMember** property isn't set before the **DataSource** property, or if the **DataMember** name isn't recognized by the object specified in the **DataSource** property.

 **Usage**




```

Dim rs as New ADODB.Recordset
rs.DataMember = "Command"     'Name of the rowset to bind to
Set rs.DataSource = myDE      'Name of the object containing an IRowset

```
