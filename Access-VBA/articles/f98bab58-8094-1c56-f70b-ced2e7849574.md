# How to: Hide the Ribbon When Access Starts

 **Last modified:** July 28, 2015

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_

By default, Microsoft Access does not provide a method for hiding the ribbon. This topic describes how to load a customized ribbon that hides all of the built-in tabs.

To load the customized ribbon when Access starts, you should store its settings in a table named  **USysRibbons**.
 The **USysRibbons** table must be created using specific column names in order for the ribbon customizations to be implemented. The following table lists the settings to use when creating the **USysRibbons** table.


|**Column Name**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**RibbonName**|Text|Contains the name of the custom ribbon to be associated with this customization. |
|**RibbonXML**|Memo|Contains the Ribbon Extensibility XML (RibbonX) that defines the ribbon customization.|
The following table lists the ribbon customization settings to store in the  **USysRibbons** table.


|**Column Name**|**Value**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**RibbonName**|HideTheRibbon|
|**RibbonXML**|<CustomUI xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/01/CustomUI"> <ribbon startFromScratch="true"/></CustomUI>|
