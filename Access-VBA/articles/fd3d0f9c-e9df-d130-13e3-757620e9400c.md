## New Features
<a name="sectionSection0"> </a>

 **[Records and Streams](74862096-2273-3b61-f89c-06554ccf42cd.md)**

This release of ADO introduces the [Record](817aaf13-78d4-1134-aa94-997e92077c22.md) object, which can represent and manage things like directories and files in a file system, and folders and messages in an e-mail system. A **Record** can also represent a row in a[Recordset](0f963bf8-f066-dc8a-b754-f427de712df1.md), although  **Record** and **Recordset** objects have different methods and properties.

The new [Stream](d49b1514-e0b4-0aca-d5c2-8266f3f4fe65.md) object provides the means to read, write, and manage the binary stream of bytes or text that comprise a file or message stream.

 **[URL Usage](79a1f793-7154-1c13-7dfe-a1b8cd64e1ea.md)**

This release also introduces the use of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), as an alternative to connection strings and command text, to name data store objects. URLs may be used with the existing [Connection](c16023aa-0321-2513-ee71-255d6ffba03d.md) and **Recordset** objects, as well as with the new **Record** and **Stream** objects.

With this release, ADO supports OLE DB providers that recognize their own URL schemes. For example, the [OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing](5d1e8db5-dabb-0914-e11e-e2eac72bfa77.md) _,_ which accesses the Windows 2000 file system, recognizes the existing HTTP scheme.

 **[Special Fields for Document Source Providers](cde72d6a-b9b0-9636-581d-68239a3f522d.md)**

A special class of providers, called  _document source_ providers, manage folders and documents. When a **Record** object represents a document, or a **Recordset** object represents a folder of documents, the document source provider populates those objects with a unique set of fields that describe characteristics of the document. These fields constitute a _resource_ **Record** or **Recordset**.
