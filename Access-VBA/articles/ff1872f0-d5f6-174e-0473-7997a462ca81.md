# ChildCount Property (ADO MD)

 **Last modified:** June 29, 2011

 _ **Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016_



Indicates the number of members for which the current [Member](d80c024a-07dc-7a35-f8f2-b4d5b19d89e4.md) object is the parent in a hierarchy.

## Return Values

Returns a  **Long** integer and is read-only.


## Remarks

Use the  **ChildCount** property to return an estimate of how many children a **Member** has. The actual children of a **Member** can be returned by the[Children](66eff203-68e5-a36d-eb2f-2e9faa80deb6.md) property.

For  **Member** objects from a[Position](f8d33cbf-6196-cce4-a140-75521677f1f4.md) object, the maximum number returned is 65536. If the actual number of children exceeds 65536, the value returned will still be 65536. Therefore, the application should interpret a **ChildCount** of 65536 as equal to or greater than 65536 children.

For  **Member** objects from a[Level](ddbcabce-8777-1068-98a3-be209084f497.md) object, use the ADO collection[Count](b59f9581-ffd1-471d-44fa-3c1bb812e140.md) property on the **Children** collection to determine the exact number of children. Determining the exact number of children may be slow if the number of children in the collection is large.
