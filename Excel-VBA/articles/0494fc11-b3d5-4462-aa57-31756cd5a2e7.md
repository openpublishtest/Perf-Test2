# Make a Cell Blink

This example shows how to make cell B2 on sheet 1 blink by changing the color and the text back and forth from red to white in the  **StartBlinking** procedure. The **StopBlinking** procedure shows how to stop the blinking by clearing the value of the cell and setting the **[ColorIndex](6d1a5bc9-7157-61e0-1e1d-b44974002c78.md)** property to white.
