# Styles Object (Excel)

A collection of all the  **[Style](3c1e9184-0075-5f46-9a1a-0b61d874d1f8.md)** objects in the specified or active workbook.


## Remarks

 Each **Style** object represents a style description for a range. The **Style** object contains all style attributes (font, number format, alignment, and so on) as properties. There are several built-in styles â€” including Normal, Currency, and Percent.


## Example

Use the  **[Styles](c9a70be9-cab5-ea5f-2e3f-949b1acf43d9.md)** property to return the **Styles** collection. The following example creates a list of style names on worksheet one in the active workbook.


```vb
For i = 1 To ActiveWorkbook.Styles.Count 
 Worksheets(1).Cells(i, 1) = ActiveWorkbook.Styles(i).Name 
Next
```

Use the  **[Add](623ed34e-d79d-2f16-475a-0c58aef04aa4.md)** method to create a new style and add it to the collection. The following example creates a new style based on the Normal style, modifies the border and font, and then applies the new style to cells A25:A30.




```vb
With ActiveWorkbook.Styles.Add(Name:="Bookman Top Border") 
 .Borders(xlTop).LineStyle = xlDouble 
 .Font.Bold = True 
 .Font.Name = "Bookman" 
End With 
Worksheets(1).Range("A25:A30").Style = "Bookman Top Border"
```

Use  **Styles** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the style index number or name, to return a single **Style** object from the workbook **Styles** collection. The following example changes the Normal style for the active workbook by setting its **Bold** property.




```vb
ActiveWorkbook.Styles("Normal").Font.Bold = True
```
