# Application Object (Excel)

Represents the entire Microsoft Excel application.


## Remarks

The  **Application** object contains:


- Application-wide settings and options.
    
- Methods that return top-level objects, such as  **[ActiveCell](7ebfbec8-dc4e-36c5-188a-347d42649e76.md)** , **[ActiveSheet](6ed42d87-2ad5-eecc-ad5b-4c92617a04bc.md)** , and so on.
    



## Example

Use the  **Application** property to return the **Application** object. The following example applies the **Windows** property to the **Application** object.


```
Application.Windows("book1.xls").Activate
```

The following example creates a Microsoft Excel workbook object in another application and then opens a workbook in Microsoft Excel.




```
Set xl = CreateObject("Excel.Sheet") 
xl.Application.Workbooks.Open "newbook.xls"
```

Many of the properties and methods that return the most common user-interface objects, such as the active cell ( **ActiveCell** property), can be used without the **Application** object qualifier. For example, instead of writing




```vb
Application.ActiveCell.Font.Bold = True
```

You can write 




```vb
ActiveCell.Font.Bold = True
```
