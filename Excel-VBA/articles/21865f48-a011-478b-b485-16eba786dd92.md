# PivotCell.AllocateChange Method (Excel)

Performs a writeback operation on the specified cell in a PivotTable report based on an OLAP data source.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AllocateChange**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[PivotCell](76b8a2dc-90ee-7475-d327-d27cb1e92703.md)** object.


### Return Value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

This method executes an  **UPDATE CUBE** statement to add just the change in this particular cell, but also includes any previous changes applied. After the **UPDATE CUBE** statement is executed, a PivotTable update is run, and then a **ROLLBACK TRANSACTION** statement is executed.

Running the  **AllocateChange** method for a cell in a PivotTable report based on a non-OLAP data source generates a run-time error.
