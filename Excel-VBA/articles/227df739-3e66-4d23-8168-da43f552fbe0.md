The following examples show how to determine if a worksheet exists, and then how to create or replace the worksheet.

 **Sample code provided by:** Tom Urtis, [Atlas Programming Management](http://www.atlaspm.com/)

## Determining if a Worksheet Exists

This example shows how to determine if a worksheet named "Sheet4" exists by using the  **[Name](3d000cdf-5e81-8701-ca7f-bdcce006363b.md)** property of the **[Worksheet](182b705e-854a-81cc-a4b0-59b942de55ae.md)** object. The name of the worksheet is specified by the `mySheetName` variable.


```vb
Sub TestSheetYesNo()
    Dim mySheetName As String, mySheetNameTest As String
    mySheetName = "Sheet4"
    
    On Error Resume Next
    mySheetNameTest = Worksheets(mySheetName).Name
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        MsgBox "The sheet named ''" &amp; mySheetName &amp; "'' DOES exist in this workbook."
    Else
        Err.Clear
        MsgBox "The sheet named ''" &amp; mySheetName &amp; "'' does NOT exist in this workbook."
    End If
End Sub
```


## Creating the Worksheet

This example shows how to determine if a worksheet named "Sheet4" exists. The name of the worksheet is specified by the  `mySheetName` variable. If the worksheet does not exist, this example shows how to create a worksheet named "Sheet4" by using the **[Add](c771d87a-64e1-e292-9db4-54386a69301e.md)** method of the **[Worksheets](5ec467a6-97e3-98d7-0b14-845d20c15910.md)** object.


```vb
Sub TestSheetCreate()
    Dim mySheetName As String, mySheetNameTest As String
    mySheetName = "Sheet4"
    
    On Error Resume Next
    mySheetNameTest = Worksheets(mySheetName).Name
    If Err.Number = 0 Then
        MsgBox "The sheet named ''" &amp; mySheetName &amp; "'' DOES exist in this workbook."
    Else
        Err.Clear
        Worksheets.Add.Name = mySheetName
        MsgBox "The sheet named ''" &amp; mySheetName &amp; "'' did not exist in this workbook but it has been created now."
    End If
End Sub
```


## Replacing the Worksheet

This example shows how to determine if a worksheet named "Sheet4" exists. The name of the worksheet is specified by the  `mySheetName` variable. If the worksheet does exist, this example shows how to delete the existing worksheet by using the **[Delete](a51e1673-e09d-824f-1acc-dda18c120204.md)** method of the **Worksheet** object, and then creates a new worksheet named "Sheet4".


 **Important**  All the data on the original worksheet named "Sheet4" is deleted when the worksheet is deleted.


```vb
Sub TestSheetReplace()
    Dim mySheetName As String
    mySheetName = "Sheet4"
    
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
    On Error Resume Next
    Worksheets(mySheetName).Delete
    Err.Clear
    Application.DisplayAlerts = True
    Worksheets.Add.Name = mySheetName
    MsgBox "The sheet named ''" &amp; mySheetName &amp; "'' has been replaced."
End Sub
```
