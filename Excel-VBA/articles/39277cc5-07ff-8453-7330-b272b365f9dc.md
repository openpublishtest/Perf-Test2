# Range.CurrentRegion Property (Excel)

Returns a  **[Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)** object that represents the current region. The current region is a range bounded by any combination of blank rows and blank columns. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **CurrentRegion**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Range** object.


## Remarks

This property is useful for many operations that automatically expand the selection to include the entire current region, such as the  **[AutoFormat](d151846e-9e0a-126f-6c20-a81e54519550.md)** method.

This property cannot be used on a protected worksheet.


## Example

This example selects the current region on Sheet1.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
ActiveCell.CurrentRegion.Select
```

This example assumes that you have a table on Sheet1 that has a header row. The example selects the table, without selecting the header row. The active cell must be somewhere in the table before you run the example.




```
Set tbl = ActiveCell.CurrentRegion 
tbl.Offset(1, 0).Resize(tbl.Rows.Count - 1, _ 
 tbl.Columns.Count).Select
```
