# Setting Control Properties

You can set some  **[controls](a85149e1-459e-f83b-3171-467a7e29ca28.md)** properties at design time (before any macro is running). In design mode, right-click a control and click  **Properties** to display the Properties window. Property names are shown in the left column in the window, and property values are shown in the right column. You set a property value by entering the new value to the right of the property name.
