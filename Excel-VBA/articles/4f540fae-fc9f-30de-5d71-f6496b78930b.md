    'Column and count variables used in the deletion process.
    Dim lnLastColumn As Long
    Dim lnColumnCount As Long
    Dim lnDeletedColumns As Long
    
    lnDeletedColumns = 0
    
    'Confirm that a range is selected, and that the range is contiguous.
    If TypeName(Selection) = "Range" Then
        If Selection.Areas.Count = 1 Then
            
            'Initialize the range to what the user has selected, and initialize the count for the upcoming FOR loop.
            Set rnSelection = Application.Selection
            lnLastColumn = rnSelection.Columns.Count
        
            'Start at the far-right column and work left: if the column is empty then
            'delete the column and increment the deleted column count.
            For lnColumnCount = lnLastColumn To 1 Step -1
                If Application.CountA(rnSelection.Columns(lnColumnCount)) = 0 Then
                    rnSelection.Columns(lnColumnCount).Delete
                    lnDeletedColumns = lnDeletedColumns + 1
                End If
            Next lnColumnCount
    
            rnSelection.Resize(lnLastColumn - lnDeletedColumns).Select
        Else
            MsgBox "Please select only one area.", vbInformation
