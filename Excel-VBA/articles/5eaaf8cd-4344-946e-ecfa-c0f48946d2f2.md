# Workbook.Password Property (Excel)

## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Password**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Workbook** object.


## Remarks

Use strong passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Weak passwords don't mix these elements. Strong password: Y6dh!et5. Weak password: House27. Passwords should be 8 or more characters in length. A pass phrase that uses 14 or more characters is better. For more information, see Help protect your personal information with strong passwords. It is critical that you remember your password. If you forget your password, Microsoft cannot retrieve it. Store the passwords that you write down in a secure place away from the information that they help protect. 


## Example

In this example, Microsoft Excel opens a workbook named Password.xls, sets a password for it, and then closes the workbook. This example assumes a file named "Password.xls" exists on the C:\ drive.


```vb
Sub UsePassword() 
 
 Dim wkbOne As Workbook 
 
 Set wkbOne = Application.Workbooks.Open("C:\Password.xls") 
 
 wkbOne.Password = InputBox ("Enter Password") 
 wkbOne.Close 
 
End Sub
```
