# ChartGroup.Overlap Property (Excel)

Specifies how bars and columns are positioned. Can be a value between - 100 and 100. Applies only to 2-D bar and 2-D column charts. Read/write  **Long** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Overlap**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ChartGroup** object.


## Remarks

If this property is set to - 100, bars are positioned so that there's one bar width between them. If the overlap is 0 (zero), there's no space between bars (one bar starts immediately after the preceding bar). If the overlap is 100, bars are positioned on top of each other.


## Example

This example sets the overlap for chart group one to - 50. The example should be run on a 2-D column chart that has two or more series.


```
Charts("Chart1").ChartGroups(1).Overlap = -50
```
