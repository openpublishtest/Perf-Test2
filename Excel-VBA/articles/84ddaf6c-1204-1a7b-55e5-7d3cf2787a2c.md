# Perspective Property

Returns or sets the perspective for the 3-D chart view. Must be from 0 through 100. This property is ignored if the  **[RightAngleAxes](5c34e5b4-a936-70a5-cd0c-d9a7a091e8d0.md)** property is **True**. Read/write  **Long**.


## Example

This example sets the perspective of  `myChart` to 70. The example should be run on a 3-D chart.


```vb
myChart.RightAngleAxes = False 
myChart.Perspective = 70
```
