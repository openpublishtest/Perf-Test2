# ChartArea Object

Represents the chart area of the specified chart. The chart area in a 2-D chart contains the axes, the chart title, the axis titles, and the legend. The chart area in a 3-D chart contains the chart title and the legend; it doesn't include the plot area (the area within the chart area where the data is plotted). For information about formatting the plot area, see the  **[PlotArea](49763ddd-3039-d15c-4ec4-e3b4f4e08d84.md)** object.


## Using the ChartArea Object

Use the  **ChartArea** property to return the **ChartArea** object. The following example sets the pattern for the chart area.


```
myChart.ChartArea.Interior.Pattern = xlLightDown
```
