# Refer to Sheets by Name

You can identify sheets by name using the  **[Worksheets](8b7d660d-ca49-0bd0-dc57-64defa47bd5e.md)** and  **[Charts](582d9a78-d86f-ab69-0c22-85f8a59412d9.md)** properties. The following statements activate various sheets in the active workbook.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Activate 
Charts("Chart1").Activate
```


```
DialogSheets("Dialog1").Activate
```

You can use the  **[Sheets](45e4e19e-55ea-9615-231d-9435ba6d5a63.md)** property to return a worksheet, chart, module, or dialog sheet. The  **Sheets** collection contains all of these kinds of sheets. The following example activates the sheet named "Chart1" in the active workbook.



```vb
Sub ActivateChart() 
 Sheets("Chart1").Activate 
End Sub
```


 **Note**   Charts embedded in a worksheet are members of the **[ChartObjects](67cf2d82-ed9b-b23d-836f-19b106bcc5ed.md)** collection, whereas charts that exist on their own sheets belong to the  **[Charts](06d4602e-a713-7ca0-db39-2d8a29f084a0.md)** collection.
