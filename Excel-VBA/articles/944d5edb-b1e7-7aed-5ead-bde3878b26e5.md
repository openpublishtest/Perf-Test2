# Point Object

Represents a single point in a series on the specified chart. The  **Point** object is a member of the **[Points](b41c8f08-880e-1f4a-0456-3f77c0741bc6.md)** collection, which contains all the points in the specified series.


## Using the Point Object

Use  **Points**( _index_), where  _index_ is the point's index number, to return a single **Point** object. Points are numbered from left to right in the series. `Points(1)` is the leftmost point, and is the leftmost point, and `Points(Points.Count)` is the rightmost point. The following example sets the marker style for the third point in series one. For this example to work, series one must be a 2-D line, scatter, or radar series.


```
myChart.SeriesCollection(1).Points(3).MarkerStyle = xlDiamond
```
