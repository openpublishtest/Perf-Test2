# TickLabels.Offset Property (Excel)

Returns or sets a  **Long** value that represents the distance between the levels of labels, and the distance between the first level and the axis line.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Offset**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TickLabels** object.


## Remarks

 The default distance is 100 percent, which represents the default spacing between the axis labels and the axis line. The value can be an integer percentage from 0 through 1000, relative to the axis label's font size.


## Example

This example sets the label spacing of the category axis in Chart1 to twice the current setting, if the offset is less than 500.


```vb
With Charts("Chart1").Axes(xlCategory).TickLabels 
 If .Offset < 500 then 
 .Offset = .Offset * 2 
 End If 
End With
```
