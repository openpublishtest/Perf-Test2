# ApplyPictToSides Property

 **True** if a picture is applied to the sides of the point or all points in the series. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Example

This example applies pictures to the sides of all points in series one. The series must already have pictures applied to it (setting this property changes the picture orientation).


```vb
myChart.SeriesCollection(1).ApplyPictToSides = True
```
