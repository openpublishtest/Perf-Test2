## Remarks

Use Clean on text imported from other applications that contains characters that may not print with your operating system. For example, you can use Clean to remove some low-level computer code that is frequently at the beginning and end of data files and cannot be printed.


 **Important**  The Clean function was designed to remove the first 32 nonprinting characters in the 7-bit ASCII code (values 0 through 31) from text. In the Unicode character set, there are additional nonprinting characters (values 127, 129, 141, 143, 144, and 157). By itself, the Clean function does not remove these additional nonprinting characters.
