For xNum = 1 To 10 
 Range("A" &amp; xNum).AddComment 
 Range("A" &amp; xNum).Comment.Text Text:="Comment " &amp; xNum 
Next 
 
MsgBox "Comments created... A1:A10" 
 
'Deletes every second comment in the A1:A10 range 
For yNum = 10 To 1 Step -2 
 Range("A" &amp; yNum).Comment.Previous.Shape.Select True 
 Selection.Delete 
Next 
 
MsgBox "Deleted every second comment"
```
