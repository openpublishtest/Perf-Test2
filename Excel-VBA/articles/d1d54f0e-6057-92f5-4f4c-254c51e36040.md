# Dialogs Object (Excel)

A collection of all the  **[Dialog](adabcd3b-fc48-d314-3ae5-f1b2ba148383.md)** objects in Microsoft Excel.


## Remarks

 Each **Dialog** object represents a built-in dialog box. You cannot create a new built-in dialog box or add one to the collection. The only useful thing you can do with a **Dialog** object is use it with the **[Show](7c69ecc2-fdd5-c91b-1c66-e3099bd69cb7.md)** method to display the dialog corresponding dialog box.

The Microsoft Excel Visual Basic object library includes built-in constants for many of the built-in dialog boxes. Each constant is formed from the prefix "xlDialog" followed by the name of the dialog box. For example, the  **Apply Names** dialog box constant is **xlDialogApplyNames** , and the **Find File** dialog box constant is **xlDialogFindFile** . These constants are members of the **[XlBuiltinDialog](18f10073-3793-f7e8-4361-72011e60cd4c.md)** enumerated type.


## Example

Use the [Dialogs](0d04aa87-9872-23e5-78e3-c9e3da2c8eb5.md) property to return the **Dialogs** collection. The following code example displays the number of available built-in Microsoft Excel dialog boxes.


```
MsgBox Application.Dialogs.Count
```

Use  **Dialogs** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is a built-in constant identifying the dialog box, to return a single **Dialog** object. The following example runs the built-in **File Open** dialog box.




```
dlgAnswer = Application.Dialogs(xlDialogOpen).Show
```
