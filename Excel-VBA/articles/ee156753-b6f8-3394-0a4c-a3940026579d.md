Use the following procedure to create a custom dialog box:


1.  [Create a User Form](edfa337f-0cb4-480e-4563-66ab45515e8d.md)
    
    On the  **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, click **UserForm**.
    
2.  [Add Controls to a User Form](a545be34-b5ed-0146-8de7-422dd4732817.md)
    
    Find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox** and drag the control onto the form.
    
3.  [Setting Control Properties](43952d29-c351-b827-6985-e18b59ddc571.md)
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click  **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
4.  [Initializing Control Properties](7d9d256c-c9e5-b45a-4da9-745d58cb666b.md)
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure before you show a form, or you can add code to the Initialize event of the form.
    
5.  [Control and Dialog Box Events](c494c76d-a712-d3fc-1eb2-37680b2239c3.md)
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a  **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
