# Comments Object (Excel)

A collection of cell comments.


## Remarks

 Each comment is represented by a **[Comment](3627e9be-2a28-9dc5-c822-ad42857134e3.md)** object.


## Example

Use the  **Comments** property to return the **Comments** collection. The following example hides all the comments on worksheet one.


```vb
Set cmt = Worksheets(1).Comments 
For Each c In cmt 
 c.Visible = False 
Next
```

Use the  **[AddComment](89bbacad-4655-bcc1-8010-2ab367cc7b31.md)** method to add a comment to a range. The following example adds a comment to cell E5 on worksheet one.




```vb
With Worksheets(1).Range("e5").AddComment 
 .Visible = False 
 .Text "reviewed on " &amp; Date 
End With
```

Use  **Comments** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the comment number, to return a single comment from the **Comments** collection. The following example hides comment two on worksheet one.




```vb
Worksheets(1).Comments(2).Visible = False
```
