# Too many local, nonstatic variables

Local, nonstatic [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are variables that are defined within a[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and reinitialized each time the procedure is called. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The sum of the memory requirements for this procedure's local, nonstatic variables and compiler-generated temporary variables exceeds 32K. Declare some of your variables with the  **Static** statement where appropriate. **Static** variables retain their value between procedure invocations because they are allocated from different memory resources than nonstatic variables.
