# The .VBP file for this project contains an invalid or corrupt library references ID

When you save a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for which a reference has been selected from the **References** dialog box, an entry is made in the project's .vbp file (called the .mak file in earlier versions of Visual Basic). For example, the entry for a data access object is:


```
Reference=*\G{00025E01-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#0.0#0#C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\DAO2516.DLL#Microsoft 
DAO 2.5 Object Library 

```


This error occurs when such a reference has been edited or corrupted. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A reference in the .vbp file has become invalid. Delete the incorrect line from the .vbp file and check the appropriate [object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the **References** dialog box from the **Tools** menu. Then save the project, and the correct information will be entered in the .vbp file.
