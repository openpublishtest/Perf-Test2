# Use the Immediate Window

The  **Immediate** window displays information resulting from debugging statements in your code or from commands typed directly into the window.

 **To display the Immediate window**




- From the  **View** menu, choose **Immediate** window (CTRL+G)
    

 **To execute code in the Immediate window**


1. Type a line of code in the  **Immediate** window.
    
2. Press ENTER to execute the statement.
    

Use the  **Immediate** window to:


- Test problematic or newly written code.
    
- Query or change the value of a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) while running an application. While execution is halted, assign the variable a new value as you would in code.
    
- Query or change a property value while running an application.
    
- Call [procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as you would in code.
    
- View debugging output while the program is running.
    
     **Note**   **Immediate** window statements are executed in a context â€” that is, as if they are entered in a specific[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

If you need help on syntax for functions, statements, [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or [methods](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) while working in the **Immediate** window, select the[keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the property name, or the method name, and press F1.
