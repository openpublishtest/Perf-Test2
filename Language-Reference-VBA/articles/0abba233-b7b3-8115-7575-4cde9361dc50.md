# Can't enter break mode at this time

[Break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is the state in which a program is still running, but its activity is suspended. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to enter break mode, for example, by pressing CTRL+BREAK, pressing the  **Break** button on the **Standard** toolbar or the **Debug** toolbar, or by executing a[breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the running code.
    
    A change was made programmatically to the [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) using the extensibility (add-in) object model. This prevents the program from having execution suspended. You can continue running, or end execution, but can't suspend execution.
