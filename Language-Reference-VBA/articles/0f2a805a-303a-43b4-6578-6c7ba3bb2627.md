The Visual Basic for Applications [object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is no longer a standalone file; it is integrated into the[dynamic-link library (DLL)](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

In earlier versions, when you started an application that uses Visual Basic for Applications, certain object libraries were loaded. This error has the following cause and solution:

However, the correct language version of these object libraries could not be found in the system[registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
