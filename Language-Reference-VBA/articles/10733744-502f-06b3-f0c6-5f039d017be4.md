The [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), object, or [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) doesn't contain the referenced[member](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You misspelled the object or member name. Check the spelling of the names and check the  **Type** statement or the object documentation to determine what the members are and the proper spelling of the object or member names.
    
- You specified a collection index that's out of range. Check the  **Count** property to determine whether a collection member exists. Note that collection indexes begin at 1 rather than zero, so the **Count** property returns the highest possible index number.
