# Execute a Specific Statement

 **To set the next statement to be executed**




1. In the  **Code** window, position the insertion point anywhere within the statement.
    
2. On the  **Debug** menu, click **Set Next Statement** (CTRL+F9). - or on Windows - Position the mouse pointer in the[margin indicator](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) next to the current execution point.
    
3. Drag the yellow arrow in the margin indicator to the statement you want to execute next.
    
     **Note**  You can only skip to statements within the same procedure.
