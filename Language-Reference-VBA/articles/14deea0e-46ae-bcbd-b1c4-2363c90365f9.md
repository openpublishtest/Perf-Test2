 This error has the following cause and solution:

Cause of the error:


- The error is raised when a compilation error exists in the VBA code inside a protected (hidden) module. The specific compilation error is not exposed because the module is protected.
    

Possible solutions:

- If you have access to the VBA code in the document or project, unprotect the module, and then run the code again to view the specific error.
    
- If you do not have access to the VBA code in the document, then contact the document author to have the code in the hidden module updated.
