# Object Property Example

Assume a new control has a  **Top** property that is different from the standard **Top** property in Microsoft Forms. You can use either property, based on the syntax:



-  `control.Top` uses the standard **Top** property.
    
-  `control.Object.Top` uses the **Top** property from the added control.
