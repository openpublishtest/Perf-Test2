# Tips on setting the dominant control

You can set the [dominant control](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) in one of the following ways when selecting multiple controls:



- SHIFT+CLICK: The dominant control is the first control you select using SHIFT+CLICK.
    
- CTRL+CLICK: The dominant control is the last control you select using CTRL+CLICK.
    
-  **Select Objects** pointer on the Toolbox: The dominant control is nearest the mouse pointer when you begin drawing the rectangle over the controls you want to select.
    

If you CTRL+CLICK twice on a selected control, that control becomes the dominant control.
