# The specified region has been searched

When you click the  **Find Next** and **Replace** buttons in the **Replace** dialog box, the total number of replacements isn't specified. This condition has the following cause and effect:



- When doing a search and replace operation, you can specify the region to be covered: a selection, a [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), a [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    If a region is selected, it is the default search region. If no region is selected, the current module is the default search region. To change the [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of a search, select a different option in the **Replace** dialog box.
