# Invalid Next control variable reference

The numeric [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the **Next** part of a **For...Next** loop must match the variable in the **For** part. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The variable in the  **Next** part of a **For...Next** loop differs from the variable in the **For** part. For example:
    
  ```
  For Counter = 1 To 10 
MyVar = Counter 
Next Count 

  ```


    Check the spelling of the variable in the  **Next** part to be sure it matches the **For** part. Also, be sure you haven't inadvertently deleted parts of the enclosing loop that used the variable.
