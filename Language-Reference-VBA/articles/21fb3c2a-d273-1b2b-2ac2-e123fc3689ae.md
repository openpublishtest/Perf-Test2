This is usually due to an extra **End Select** below a **Select Case** block, or leaving behind the **End Select** statement when copying a **Select Case** block from one[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to another. Check each **End Select** statement to make sure it terminates a **Select Case** structure.
