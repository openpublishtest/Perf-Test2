# Drives Property



 **Description**
Returns a  **Drives** collection consisting of all **Drive** objects available on the local machine.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Drives**
The  _object_ is always a **FileSystemObject**.
 **Remarks**
Removable-media drives need not have media inserted for them to appear in the  **Drives** collection.
You can iterate the members of the  **Drives** collection using a **For Each...Next** construct as illustrated in the following code:



```
Sub ShowDriveList
    Dim fs, d, dc, s, n
    Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set dc = fs.Drives
    For Each d in dc
        s = s &amp; d.DriveLetter &amp; " - " 
        If d.DriveType = 3 Then
            n = d.ShareName
        Else
            n = d.VolumeName
        End If
        s = s &amp; n &amp; vbCrLf
    Next
    MsgBox s
End Sub

```
