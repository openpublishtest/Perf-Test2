# ReadAll Method



 **Description**
Reads an entire  **TextStream** file and returns the resulting string.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **ReadAll**
The  _object_ is always the name of a **TextStream** object.
 **Remarks**
For large files, using the  **ReadAll** method wastes memory resources. Other techniques should be used to input a file, such as reading a file line by line.
