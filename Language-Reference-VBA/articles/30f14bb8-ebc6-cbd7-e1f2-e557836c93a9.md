# Current module does not support Print method

Not all [methods](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and[properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are appropriate in all[modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to use the  **Print** method on an object that can't display anything. For example, you can't use the **Print** method without qualification in a[standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Remove the reference to the  **Print** method, or qualify it with an appropriate object. For example, qualify it with the **Debug** object to display its arguments in the **Immediate** window during debugging.
    
- You tried to use the  **Line**, **Circle**, **PSet**, or **Scale** method on an object that can't accept them. For example, they can't appear unqualified in a standard module or an Automation[class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
