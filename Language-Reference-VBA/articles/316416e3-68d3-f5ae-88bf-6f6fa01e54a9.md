# Forward reference to user-defined type

A [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) must be defined before it can be referenced. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You declared a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) with a user-defined type before the definition of the user-defined type appears. In the following example, the variable `OtherVar` is declared before its type ( `OtherType`) is known:
    
  ```
  Type MyType 
OtherVar As OtherType 
End Type 
 
Type OtherType 
WholeVar As Integer 
RealVar As Double 
End Type 

  ```


    Reposition the type definitions so that the forward reference doesn't occur.
    
- You nested a user-defined type within itself.
    
  ```
  Type MyType 
MyVar As Integer 
OtherVar As MyType 
End Type 

  ```


     Remove the self-referencing nested type. This may occur indirectly if you nest a type within another type in which the first is already declared. Check the definition of each nested type to eliminate duplication.
