# Count Property (Visual Basic for Applications)



Returns a [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (long integer) containing the number of objects in a[collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Read-only.

## Example

This example uses the  **Collection** object's **Count** property to specify how many iterations are required to remove all the elements of the collection called `MyClasses`. When collections are numerically indexed, the base is 1 by default. Since collections are reindexed automatically when a removal is made, the following code removes the first member on each iteration.


```
Dim Num, MyClasses
For Num = 1 To MyClasses. Count    ' Remove name from the collection.
    MyClasses.Remove 1    ' Default collection numeric indexes
Next    ' begin at 1.
```
