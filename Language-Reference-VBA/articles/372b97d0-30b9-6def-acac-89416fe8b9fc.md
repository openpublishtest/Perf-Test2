The distance between a control and the left or top edge of the form that contains it.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Left** [= _Single_ ]
 _object_. **Top** [= _Single_ ]
The  **Left** and **Top** property syntaxes have these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Single_|Optional. A numeric expression specifying the coordinates of an object.|
 **Settings**
Setting the  **Left** or **Top** property to 0 places the control's edge at the left or top edge of its[container](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Remarks**
For most systems, the recommended range of values for  **Left** and **Top** is from -32,767 to +32,767. Other values may also work depending on your sytem configuration. For a **ComboBox**, values of **Left** and **Top** apply to the text portion of the control, not to the list portion. When you move or size a control, its new **Left** setting is automatically entered in the property sheet. When you print a form, the control's horizontal or vertical location is determined by its **Left** or **Top** setting.
