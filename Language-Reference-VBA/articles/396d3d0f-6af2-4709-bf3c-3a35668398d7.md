# Return without GoSub (Error 3)

A  **Return** statement must have a corresponding **GoSub** statement. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You have a  **Return** statement that can't be matched with a **GoSub** statement. Make sure your **GoSub** statement wasn't inadvertently deleted.
    

Unlike  **For...Next**, **While...Wend**, and **Sub...End Sub**, which are matched at[compile time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  **GoSub** and **Return** are matched at[run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
