# Division by zero (Error 11)

Division by zero isn't possible. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The value of an [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) being used as a divisor is zero.
    
    Check the spelling of [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero. Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as[arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) from other procedures.
