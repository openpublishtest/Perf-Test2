# AfterUpdate Event



Occurs after data in a control is changed through the user interface.
 **Syntax**
 **Private Sub**_object_ _**AfterUpdate( )**
The  **AfterUpdate** event syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
The AfterUpdate event occurs regardless of whether the control is [bound](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) (that is, when the **RowSource** property specifies a[data source](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) for the control). This event cannot be canceled. If you want to cancel the update (to restore the previous value of the control), use the BeforeUpdate event and set the _Cancel_ argument to **True**.
The AfterUpdate event occurs after the BeforeUpdate event and before the Exit event for the current control and before the Enter event for the next control in the [tab order](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
