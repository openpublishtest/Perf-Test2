# Pages Collection (Microsoft Forms)



A  **Pages** collection includes all the pages of a **MultiPage**.
 **Remarks**
Each  **Pages** collection provides the features to manage the number of pages in the[collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and to identify the page that is currently in use.
A  **Page** object has a unique name and index value within a **Pages** collection. You can reference a **Page** either by its name or its index value. The index of the first **Page** in a collection is 0; the index of the second **Page** is 1; and so on. The default name for the first page is Page1; the default name for the second page is Page2.
The default value of a  **Pages** collection identifies the current **Page** of a collection.
