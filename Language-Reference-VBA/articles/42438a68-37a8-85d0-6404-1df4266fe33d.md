# Understanding Parameter Arrays

A [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)[array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can be used to pass an array of[arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to a[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). You don't have to know the number of elements in the array when you define the procedure.

You use the  **ParamArray** keyword to denote a parameter array. The array must be declared as an array of type **Variant**, and it must be the last argument in the procedure definition.

The following example shows how you might define a procedure with a parameter array.




```
Sub AnyNumberArgs(strName As String, ParamArray intScores() As Variant) 
 Dim intI As Integer 
 
 Debug.Print strName; " Scores" 
 ' Use UBound function to determine upper limit of array. 
 For intI = 0 To UBound(intScores()) 
 Debug.Print " "; intScores(intI) 
 Next intI 
End Sub 

```

The following examples show how you can call this procedure.



```
AnyNumberArgs "Jamie", 10, 26, 32, 15, 22, 24, 16 
 
AnyNumberArgs "Kelly", "High", "Low", "Average", "High" 

```
