# Property Set can't be used with a read-only property (Error 383)

It may not be possible to obtain a reference to a [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) at[run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to get a reference to a property that's read-only at run time. Since you can use a reference for both reading and writing, the property must provide run-time support for both operations for a reference to be obtained at run time. You can only use a  **Property Get** with this property.
