# Object library's language setting incompatible with current project

The reference couldn't be added. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You attempted to add a reference to an [object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) whose[locale](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) isn't compatible with the locale of the current[project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). The reference was not added. To use that object library, a project whose locale is compatible with it must be created.
    
    Try registering both Visual Basic for Applications and the [host application](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the given language. The object library then becomes available in the **References** dialog box.
    
     **Note**  When Visual Basic is the host application, it isn't possible to change a project's language setting. Any object libraries used must be compatible with the English/U.S. setting.
