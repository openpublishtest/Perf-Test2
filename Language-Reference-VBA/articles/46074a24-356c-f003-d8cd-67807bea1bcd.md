# Item Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)



Returns the indexed member of a [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Item(**_index_**)**
The  **Item** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _index_|Required. An expression that specifies the position of a member of the collection. If a [numeric expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  _index_ must be a number from 1 to the value of the collection's **Count** property. If a[string expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md),  _index_ must correspond to the _key_[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specified when the member was added to the collection.|
The following table lists the collections and their corresponding  _key_ arguments for use with the **Item** method. The string you pass to the **Item** method must match the collection's _key_ argument.


|**Collection**|**Key argument**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Windows**|**Caption** property setting|
|**LinkedWindows**|**Caption** property setting|
|**CodePanes**|No unique string is associated with this collection.|
|**VBProjects**|**Name** property setting|
|**VBComponents**|**Name** property setting|
|**References**|**Name** property setting|

 **Remarks**
The  _index_ argument can be a numeric value or a string containing the title of the object.
