# Working Across Applications

Visual Basic can create new [objects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and retrieve existing objects from many Microsoft applications. Other applications may also provide objects that you can create using Visual Basic. See the application's documentation for more information.

To create an new object or get an existing object from another application, use the  **CreateObject** function or **GetObject** function:



```
' Start Microsoft Excel and create a new Worksheet object. 
Set ExcelWorksheet = CreateObject("Excel.Sheet") 
 
' Start Microsoft Excel and open an existing Worksheet object. 
Set ExcelWorksheet = GetObject("SHEET1.XLS") 
 
' Start Microsoft Word. 
Set WordBasic = CreateObject("Word.Basic") 

```

Most applications provide an  **Exit** or **Quit** method that closes the application whether or not it is visible. For more information on the objects, methods, and properties an application provides, see the application's documentation.
Some applications allow you to use the  **New**[keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to create an object of any class that exists in its[type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For example:



```
Dim X As New Field 

```

In this case, is an example of a [class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in the data access type library. A new instance of a **Field** object is created using this syntax. Refer to the application's documentation for information about which object classes can be created in this way.
