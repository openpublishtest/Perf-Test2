# Image Control



Displays a picture on a form.
 **Remarks**
The  **Image** lets you display a picture as part of the data in a form. For example, you might use an **Image** to display employee photographs in a personnel form.
The  **Image** lets you crop, size, or zoom a picture, but does not allow you to edit the contents of the picture. For example, you cannot use the **Image** to change the colors in the picture, to make the picture[transparent](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md), or to refine the image of the picture. You must use image editing software for these purposes.
The  **Image** supports the following file formats:


- *.bmp
    
- *.cur
    
- *.gif
    
- *.ico
    
- *.jpg
    
- *.wmf
    


 **Note**  You can also display a picture on a  **Label**. However, a **Label** does not let you crop, size, or zoom the picture.

The default event for the  **Image** is the Click event.
