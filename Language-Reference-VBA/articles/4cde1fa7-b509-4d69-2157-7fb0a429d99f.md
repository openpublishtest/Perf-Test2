# Can't perform requested operation (Error 17)

An operation can't be carried out if it would invalidate the current state of the [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- The requested operation would invalidate the current state of the project. For example, the error occurs if you use the  **References** dialog box to add a reference to a new project or[object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) while a program is in[break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Stop execution of the current code, and then retry the operation.
    
- An attempt was made to programmatically modify currently running code. For example, your code may have tried to read code from a disk file into a currently running [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Although you can modify modules in the project while they aren't actually running, you can't make modifications to a running module. To make such changes, you must stop the module from running, make the additions or changes, and then restart execution.
