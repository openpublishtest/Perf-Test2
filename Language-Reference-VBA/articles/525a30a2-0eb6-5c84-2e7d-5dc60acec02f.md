# Split the Code Window

You can split the  **Code** window horizontally into two panes to view different code segments of a[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) at the same time. Each pane scrolls separately, both horizontally and vertically. The[Procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and[Object box](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) options refer to the pane that has the focus. Code changes are immediately reflected in both panes.
