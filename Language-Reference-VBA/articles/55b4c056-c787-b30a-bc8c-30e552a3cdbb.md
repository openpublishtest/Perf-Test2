# Duplicate declaration in current scope

The specified name is already used at this level of [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For example, two [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can have the same name if they are defined in different[procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but not if they are defined within the same procedure. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- A new variable or procedure has the same name as an existing variable or procedure. For example:
    
  ```
  Sub MySub() 
Dim A As Integer 
Dim A As Variant 
. . .        ' Other declarations or procedure code here. 
End Sub 

  ```


     Check the current procedure,[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and remove any duplicate declarations.
    
- A  **Const** statement uses the same name as an existing variable or procedure. Remove or rename the[constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in question.
    
- You declared a fixed [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) more than once.
    
    Remove or rename one of the arrays.
    

Search for the duplicate name. When specifying the name to search for, omit any [type-declaration character](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) because a conflict occurs if the names are the same and the type-declaration characters are different.
Note that a [module-level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) variable can have the same name as a variable declared in a procedure, but when you want to refer to the module-level variable within the procedure, you must qualify it with the module name. Module names and the names of[referenced projects](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can be reused as variable names within procedures and can also be qualified.
