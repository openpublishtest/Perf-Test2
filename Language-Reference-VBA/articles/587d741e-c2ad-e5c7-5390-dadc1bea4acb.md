# Can't save file to TEMP directory (Error 735)

Components often need to save temporary information to disk. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Component can't find a directory named TEMP. Create a directory named TEMP and set the TEMP environment variable equal to its path.
    
- The drive or partition containing the TEMP directory lacks sufficient space to save information. Make some space on the drive by erasing unnecessary files, or create a TEMP directory on another partition and set the TEMP environment variable equal to its path.
