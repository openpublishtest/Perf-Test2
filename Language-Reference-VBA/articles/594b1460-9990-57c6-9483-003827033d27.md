# Cannot define a KWID_tkPUBLIC user-defined type within a private object module

A [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that appears within an[object module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can't be **Public**. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to define a  **Public** user-defined type in an object module. Move the user-defined type definition to a[standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and then declare [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the type in the object module or other[modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), as appropriate. If you only want the type to be available in the module in which it appears, you can place its  **Type...End Type** definition in the object module and precede its definition with the **Private**[keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
