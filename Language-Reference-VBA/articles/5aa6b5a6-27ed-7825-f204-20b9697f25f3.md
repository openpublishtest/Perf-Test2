# Must be first statement on the line

Not all [keywords](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can appear at the beginning of a line of code. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You preceded a  **Sub**, **Function**, or **Property** statement with another statement on the same line. A **Sub**, **Function**, or **Property** statement must always be the first statement on any line in which it appears (unless preceded by the keyword **Public**, **Private**, or **Static** ).
    
- You preceded an  **End If**, **Else**, or **ElseIf** statement with another statement on the same line. An **End If**, **Else**, or **ElseIf** (only when used in a block **If** structure) statement must always be the first statement on any line in which it appears.
