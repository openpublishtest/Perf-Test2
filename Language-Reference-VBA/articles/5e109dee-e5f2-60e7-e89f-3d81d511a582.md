# Invalid qualifier

Qualifiers are used for disambiguation. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The qualifier does not identify a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), object, or a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of[user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) within the current[scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Check the spelling of the qualifier. Make sure that the qualifying [identifier](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is within the current scope. For example, a variable of user-defined type in a **Private** module is visible only within that module.
