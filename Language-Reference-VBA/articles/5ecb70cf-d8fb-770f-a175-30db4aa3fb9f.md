# Integer Data Type

[Integer variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are stored as 16-bit (2-byte) numbers ranging in value from -32,768 to 32,767. The[type-declaration character](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for **Integer** is the percent sign ( **%** ).

You can also use  **Integer** variables to represent enumerated values. An enumerated value can contain a finite set of unique whole numbers, each of which has special meaning in the context in which it is used. Enumerated values provide a convenient way to select among a known number of choices, for example, black = 0, white = 1, and so on. It is good programming practice to define[constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) using the **Const** statement for each enumerated value.
