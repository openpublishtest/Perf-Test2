# Decimal Data Type

[Decimal variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are stored as 96-bit (12-byte) signed integers scaled by a variable power of 10. The power of 10 scaling factor specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point, and ranges from 0 to 28. With a scale of 0 (no decimal places), the largest possible value is +/-79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335. With a 28 decimal places, the largest value is +/-7.9228162514264337593543950335 and the smallest, non-zero value is +/-0.0000000000000000000000000001.


 **Note**  At this time the  **Decimal** data type can only be used within a[Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), that is, you cannot declare a variable to be of type  **Decimal**. You can, however, create a **Variant** whose subtype is **Decimal** using the **CDec** function.
