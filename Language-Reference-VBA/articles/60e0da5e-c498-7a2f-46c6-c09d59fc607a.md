# User-defined type not defined

You can create your own [data types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in Visual Basic, but they must be defined first in a **Type...End Type** statement or in a properly registered[object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to declare a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) with an undefined data type or you specified an unknown[class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or object.
    
    Use the  **Type** statement in a[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to define a new data type. If you are trying to create a reference to a class, the class must be visible to the[project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). If you are referring to a class in your program, you must have a [class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the specified name in your project. Check the spelling of the type name or name of the object.
    
- The type you want to declare is in another module but has been declared  **Private**. Move the definition of the type to a[standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) where it can be **Public**.
    
- The type is a valid type, but the object library or type library in which it is defined isn't registered in Visual Basic. Display the  **References** dialog box, and then select the appropriate object library or type library. For example, if you don't check the **Data Access Object** in the **References** dialog box, types like Database, Recordset, and TableDef aren't recognized and references to them in code cause this error.
