# Procedure type mismatch

You are using one kind of  **Property** procedure where a different kind is expected. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You are trying to write to a [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that is read-only.
    
    If the only [property procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) defined for the property is a **Property Get**, you can't assign a value to the property. Either write an appropriate **Property Let** procedure, or don't attempt to write to the property.
    
- You are trying to read a property that is write-only. If the only property procedure defined for the property is a  **Property Let**, you can't read the value of the property. Either write an appropriate **Property Get** procedure, or don't attempt to write to the property.
    
- You are trying to set a reference but the property has only  **Property Get** or **Property Let** procedures. Either write a **Property Set** procedure for the property, or don't try to set a reference to it.
