Only [comments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), directives, and [declarations](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are permitted outside[procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You placed executable code outside a procedure. Any nondeclarative lines outside a procedure must begin with a comment delimiter ( **'** ). Declarative statements must appear before the first procedure declaration. Comments are ignored when the code executes.
