Complete error message:

The code in this project must be updated for use on 64-bit systems. Please review and update Declare statements and then mark them with the  **PtrSafe** attribute.

All  **[Declare Statements](82f68f6b-76c6-2efd-72d2-652000b3a083.md)** must now include the **[PtrSafe](f413edb2-2839-efec-534a-eceb8d3da787.md)** keyword when running in 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office. The **PtrSafe** keyword indicates a **Declare** statement is safe to run in 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office.

Adding the  **PtrSafe** keyword to a **Declare** statement only signifies the **Declare** statement explicitly targets 64-bits, all data types within the statement that need to store 64-bits (including return values and parameters) must still be modified to hold 64-bit quantities using either[LongLong](731bd14c-4523-cb84-cc00-21730fa745a8.md) for 64-bit integrals or[LongPtr](10ee4c07-b686-5b86-5cea-250a9218e7ba.md) for pointers and handles.
