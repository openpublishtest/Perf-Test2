# Invalid type-declaration character

[Type-declaration characters](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are valid, but don't exist for all[data types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); they aren't permitted in some situations. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- A type-declaration character is appended to a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) declared in a **Private**, **Public**, or **Static** statement with an **As** clause.
    
    Remove the type-declaration character.
    
- A type-declaration character is appended to an inconsistent literal. For example, since the ampersand ( **&amp;** ) is the type-declaration character for a **Long** integer, appending it to a literal of a different type causes this error:
    
  ```
  10.253&amp; 

  ```


     Remove the type-declaration character or replace it with the correct one.
