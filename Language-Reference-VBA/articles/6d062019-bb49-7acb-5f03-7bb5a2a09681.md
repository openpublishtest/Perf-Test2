# Me <keyword>

The  **Me**[keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) behaves like an implicitly declared[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). It is automatically available to every [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in a[class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). When a [class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can have more than one instance, **Me** provides a way to refer to the specific instance of the class where the code is executing. Using **Me** is particularly useful for passing information about the currently executing instance of a class to a procedure in another[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For example, suppose you have the following procedure in a module:


```
Sub ChangeFormColor(FormName As Form) 
 FormName.BackColor = RGB(Rnd * 256, Rnd * 256, Rnd * 256) 
End Sub 

```


You can call this procedure and pass the current instance of the Form class as an [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) using the following[statement](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md):




```
ChangeFormColor Me 

```
