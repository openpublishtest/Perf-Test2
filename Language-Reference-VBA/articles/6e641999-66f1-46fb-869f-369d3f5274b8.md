# LSet allowed only on strings and user-defined types

 **LSet** is used to left align data within strings and[variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of[user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- The specified variable isn't a string or user-defined type. If you are trying to block assign one array to another,  **LSet** does not work. You must use a loop to assign each element individually.
    
- You tried to use  **LSet** with an object. **LSet** can also be used to assign the elements of a user-defined type variable to the elements of a different, but compatible, user-defined type. Although objects are similar to user-defined types, you can't use **LSet** on them. Similarly, you can't use **LSet** on variables of user-defined types that contain strings, objects, or variants.
