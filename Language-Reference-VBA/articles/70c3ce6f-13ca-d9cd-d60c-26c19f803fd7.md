# Qualifier must be collection

The use of an exclamation point between two [identifiers](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is specific to[collections](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You used a name on the left side of the exclamation point ( **!** ) that isn't the name of a collection. If the name is supposed to represent a collection, check to make sure the name is spelled correctly. Note that the exclamation point is also the[type-declaration character](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the **Single** data type. If the name in question isn't supposed to be a collection, perhaps the **!** type-declaration character appended to a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) name has been concatenated with another name.
