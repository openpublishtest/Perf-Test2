# Bad record number (Error 63)

An error occurred during the attempted file access. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The record number in a  **Put** or **Get** statement is less than or equal to zero. Check the calculations used in generating the record number. Make sure that the[variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing the record number or used in calculating record numbers are spelled correctly. A misspelled variable name is implicitly declared and initialized to zero, unless you have properly placed **Option Explicit** in the[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
