# Writing Assignment Statements

Assignment statements assign a value or [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Assignment statements always include an equal sign ( **=** ). The following example assigns the return value of the **InputBox** function to the variable .


```
Sub Question() 
 Dim yourName As String 
 yourName = InputBox("What is your name?") 
 MsgBox "Your name is " &amp; yourName 
End Sub 

```


The  **Let** statement is optional and is usually omitted. For example, the preceding assignment statement can be written:




```
Let yourName = InputBox("What is your name?"). 

```

The  **Set** statement is used to assign an object to a variable that has been declared as an object. The **Set** keyword is required. In the following example, the **Set** statement assigns a range on `Sheet1` to the object variable to the object variable `myCell`:



```
Sub ApplyFormat() 
Dim myCell As Range 
Set myCell = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1") 
 With myCell.Font 
 .Bold = True 
 .Italic = True 
 End With 
End Sub 

```

Statements that set [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) values are also assignment statements. The following example sets the **Bold** property of the **Font** object for the active cell:



```
ActiveCell.Font.Bold = True 

```
