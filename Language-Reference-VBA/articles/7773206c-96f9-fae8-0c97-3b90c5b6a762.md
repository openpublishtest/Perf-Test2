# End If without block If

An  **End If** statement must have a corresponding **If** statement. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The  **If** clause was omitted or is separated from the **End If**. Check other control structures within the **If...End If** structure and verify that they are correctly matched. Also check that the block **If** is correctly formatted.
