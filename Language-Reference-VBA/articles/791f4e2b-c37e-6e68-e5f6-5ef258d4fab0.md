# Invalid ParamArray use

The [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) defined as **ParamArray** is used incorrectly in the[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You attempted to pass  **ParamArray** as an[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to another procedure that expects an[array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or a **ByRef Variant**.
    
    Assign the  **ParamArray** parameter to a **Variant**, and then pass the variant.
    
- You attempted to use an  **Erase** or **ReDim** statement with a **ParamArray** parameter within its procedure. Remove the **Erase** or **ReDim**. These operations can't be performed on the **ParamArray** parameter.
