# FileSystemObject Object



 **Description**
Provides access to a computer's file system.
 **Syntax**
 **Scripting.FileSystemObject**
 **Remarks**
The following code illustrates how the  **FileSystemObject** is used to return a **TextStream** object that can be read from or written to:



```
Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set a = fs.CreateTextFile("c:\testfile.txt", True)
a.WriteLine("This is a test.")
a.Close
```

In the code shown above, the  **CreateObject** function returns the **FileSystemObject** ( `fs` ). The **CreateTextFile** method then creates the file as a **TextStream** object ( `a` ), and the **WriteLine** method writes a line of text to the created text file. The **Close** method flushes the buffer and closes the file.
