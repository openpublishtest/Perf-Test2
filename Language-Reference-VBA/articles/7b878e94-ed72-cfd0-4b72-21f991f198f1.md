# Save <host document> Command (File Menu)

Saves the current project and all of its components - forms and [modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) - with your document. A standalone project is saved separately as a project file with a .vba extension.

The  **Save** command displays the **Save As** dialog box if this is the first time the project is being saved.
