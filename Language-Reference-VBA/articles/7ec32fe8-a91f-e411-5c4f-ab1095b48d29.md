# #Else If, #Else, or #End If must be preceded by a matching #If

# **Else If**, # **Else**, and # **End If** are conditional compilation directives. This error has the following cause and solution:



- An # **Else If**, # **Else**, or # **End If** was detected that isn't preceded by a matching # **If** clause. Check to see if the intended # **If** has been separated from the clause in question by an intervening block or if the intended # **If** is preceded by a number sign ( **#** ) sign. If everything else is in order, place an # **If** clause in the appropriate position.
