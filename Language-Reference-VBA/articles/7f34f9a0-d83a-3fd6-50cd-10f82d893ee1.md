# Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object (Error 451)

Certain [properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [methods](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and operations can only apply to  **Collection** objects. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You specified an operation or property that is exclusive to [collections](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but the object isn't a collection.
    
    Check the spelling of the object or property name, or verify that the object is a  **Collection** object. Also look at the **Add** method used to add the object to the collection to be sure the syntax is correct and that any[identifiers](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) were spelled correctly.
