# Writing a Function Procedure

A  **Function** procedure is a series of Visual Basic[statements](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) enclosed by the **Function** and **End Function** statements. A **Function** procedure is similar to a **Sub** procedure, but a function can also return a value. A **Function** procedure can take[arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), such as [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or [expressions](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that are passed to it by a calling procedure. If a **Function** procedure has no arguments, its **Function** statement must include an empty set of parentheses. A function returns a value by assigning a value to its name in one or more statements of the procedure.

In the following example, the  **Celsius** function calculates degrees Celsius from degrees Fahrenheit. When the function is called from the **Main** procedure, a variable containing the argument value is passed to the function. The result of the calculation is returned to the calling procedure and displayed in a message box.



```
Sub Main() 
 temp = Application.InputBox(Prompt:= _ 
 "Please enter the temperature in degrees F.", Type:=1) 
 MsgBox "The temperature is " &amp; Celsius(temp) &amp; " degrees C." 
End Sub 
 
Function Celsius(fDegrees) 
 Celsius = (fDegrees - 32) * 5 / 9 
End Function 

```
