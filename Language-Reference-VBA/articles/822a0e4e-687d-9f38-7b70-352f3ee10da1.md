# Writing Executable Statements

An executable [statement](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) initiates action. It can execute a[method](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or function, and it can loop or branch through blocks of code. Executable statements often contain mathematical or conditional operators.

The following example uses a  **For Each...Next** statement to iterate through each cell in a range named `MyRange` on `Sheet1` of an active Microsoft Excel workbook. The variable `c` is a cell in the collection of cells contained in on `Sheet1` of an active Microsoft Excel workbook. The variable `c` is a cell in the collection of cells contained in `MyRange`.



```
Sub ApplyFormat() 
Const limit As Integer = 33 
For Each c In Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("MyRange").Cells 
    If c.Value > limit Then 
        With c.Font 
            .Bold = True 
            .Italic = True 
        End With 
    End If 
Next c 
MsgBox "All done!" 
End Sub 

```

The  **If...Then...Else** statement in the example checks the value of the cell. If the value is greater than 33, the **With** statement sets the **Bold** and **Italic** properties of the **Font** object for that cell. **If...Then...Else** statements end with **End If**.
The  **With** statement can save typing because the statements it contains are automatically executed on the object following the **With** keyword.
The  **Next** statement calls the next cell in the collection of cells contained in `MyRange`.
The  **MsgBox** function (which displays a built-in Visual Basic dialog box) displays a message indicating that the **Sub** procedure has finished running.
