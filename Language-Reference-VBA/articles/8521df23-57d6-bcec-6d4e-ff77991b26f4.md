|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _fmCycleAllForms_|0|[Cycles](7ce2c60f-29fb-96e2-2516-73c99a6e7cff.md) through the controls on the form and the controls of the **Frame** and **MultiPage** controls that are currently displayed on the form.|
| _fmCycleCurrentForm_|2|Cycles through the controls on the form,  **Frame**, or **MultiPage**. The focus stays within the form, **Frame**, or **MultiPage** until the focus is explicitly set to a control outside the form, **Frame**, or **MultiPage**.|

 **Remarks**
The [tab order](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) identifies the order in which controls receive the[focus](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as the user tabs through a form or subform. The **Cycle** property determines the action to take when a user tabs from the last control in the tab order.
The  **fmCycleAllForms** setting transfers the focus to the the first control of the next **Frame** or **MultiPage** on the form when the user tabs from the last control in the tab order.
The  **fmCycleCurrentForm** setting transfers the focus to the the first control of the same form, **Frame**, or **MultiPage** when the user tabs from the last control in the tab order.
