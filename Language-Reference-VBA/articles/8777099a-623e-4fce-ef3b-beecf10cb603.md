# Using Data Types Efficiently

Unless otherwise specified, undeclared [variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are assigned the[Variant data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This data type makes it easy to write programs, but it is not always the most efficient data type to use.

You should consider using other data types if:




- Your program is very large and uses many variables.
    
- Your program must run as quickly as possible.
    
- You write data directly to random-access files.
    

In addition to  **Variant**, supported data types include **Byte**, **Boolean**, **Integer**, **Long**, **Single**, **Double**, **Currency**, **Decimal**, **Date**, **Object**, and **String**. Use the **Dim** statement to declare a variable of a specific type, for example:



```
Dim X As Integer 

```

This statement declares that a variable  `X` is an integer â€” a whole number between -32,768 and 32,767. If you try to set `X` to a number outside that range, an error occurs. If you try to set `X` to a fraction, the number is rounded. For example:



```
X = 32768        ' Causes error. 
X = 5.9        ' Sets x to 6. 

```
