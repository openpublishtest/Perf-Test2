# Circular dependencies between modules

Circular references between [modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and [user-defined types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) aren't allowed. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A user-defined type or constant in one module references a user-defined type or constant in a second module, which in turn references another user-defined type or constant in the first module. Remove the dependent references.
