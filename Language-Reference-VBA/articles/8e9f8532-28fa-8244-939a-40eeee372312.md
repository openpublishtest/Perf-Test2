You can only define a [conditional compiler constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to have one value. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You specified two different values for the same conditional compiler constant, for example:
    
  ```
  #Const Mac = 0 
#Const Mac = 1 

  ```
