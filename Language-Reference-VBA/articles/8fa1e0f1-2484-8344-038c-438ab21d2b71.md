# Named argument already specified

You can use a [named argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) only once in the[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) list of each[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) invocation. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You specified the same named argument more than once in a single call. For example, if the procedure  `MySub` expects the named arguments `Arg1` and `Arg2`, the following call would generate this error:
    
  ```
  Call MySub(Arg1 := 3, Arg1 := 5) 

  ```


     Remove one of the duplicate specifications.
    
- You specified the same [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) both by position and with a named argument, for example:
    
  ```
  Call MySub(1, Arg1 := 3) 

  ```


    Remove one of the duplicate specifications.
