# Variable not yet created in this context

A [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) has to be created before it can be displayed in the **Watch** window or the **Immediate** window, and before it can have values assigned to it in the **Immediate** window. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to display the value of a local variable that you just entered in your code before executing at least a  **Single Step** command in[break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Step into the code to force compilation of the new statement.
    
- You tried to display the value of a local variable that you just added in a [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) farther down the call chain by moving to the procedure using the **Calls** dialog box.
    
    You have to actually return to the procedure before you can display the variable in its context.
