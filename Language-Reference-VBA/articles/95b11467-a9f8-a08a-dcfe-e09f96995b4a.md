# Toolbox


![](images/toolbox_ZA01201770.gif)



Displays the standard Visual Basic controls plus any ActiveX controls and insertable objects you have added to your project.




- You can customize the  **Toolbox** by adding pages to it or by adding controls using the **Additional** **Controls** command from the **Tools** menu. When you add a page, a **Select** **Objects** tool is always available on the page.
    


## Standard Toolbox Controls


![](images/tb_pntr_ZA01201663.gif) **Select Objects**

Select Objects is the only item in the  **Toolbox** that doesn't draw a control. When you select it, you can only resize or move a control that has already been drawn on a form.

Provides a graphical tool for quickly navigating through a long list of items or a large amount of information, for indicating the current position on a scale, or as an input device or indicator of speed or quantity.


![](images/tb_spinb_ZA01201664.gif) **SpinButton**

A spinner control you can use with another control to increment and decrement numbers. You can also use it to scroll back and forth through a range of values or a list of items.


![](images/avhtb003_ZA01201579.gif) **Image**

Displays a graphical image from a [bitmap](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [icon](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or [metafile](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) on your form. Images displayed in an **Image** control can only be decorative and use fewer resources than a **PictureBox**.
