# Add Method (VBA Add-In Object Model)



Adds an object to a [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Add(**_component_**)**
The  **Add** syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _component_|Required. For the  **LinkedWindows** collection, an object. For the **VBComponents** collection, an enumerated[constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) representing a[class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), a form, or a [standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). For the  **VBProjects** collection, an enumerated constant representing a project type.|
You can use one of the following constants for the  _component_ argument:


|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**vbext_ct_ClassModule**|Adds a class module to the collection.|
|**vbext_ct_MSForm**|Adds a form to the collection.|
|**vbext_ct_StdModule**|Adds a standard module to the collection.|
|**vbext_pt_StandAlone**|Adds a standalone project to the collection.|
 **Remarks**
For the  **LinkedWindows** collection, the **Add** method adds a window to the collection of currently[linked windows](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

 **Note**  You can add a window that is a pane in one [linked window frame](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to another linked window frame; the window is simply moved from one pane to the other. If the linked window frame that the window was moved from no longer contains any panes, it's destroyed.



 **Important**  Objects, properties, and methods for controlling linked windows, linked window frames, and docked windows are included on the Macintosh for compatibility with code written in Windows. However, these language elements generate run-time errors when run on the Macintosh.


For the  **VBComponents** collection, the **Add** method creates a new standard component and adds it to the[project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
For the  **VBComponents** collection, the **Add** method returns a **VBComponent** object. For the **LinkedWindows** collection, the **Add** method returns **Nothing**.
For the  **VBProjects** collection, the **Add** method returns a **VBProject** object and adds a project to the **VBProjects** collection.
