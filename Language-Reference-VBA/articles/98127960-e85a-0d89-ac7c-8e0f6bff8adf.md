# Event handler is invalid

The [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) list of an event-handling[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) must precisely match the declaration of the event. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Your event-handling procedure has the wrong number of parameters. Eliminate extra parameters or add the missing ones.
    
- One or more of your event-handling procedure parameters has the wrong [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Make the parameter types match those of the event declaration.
    
- Your event-handling procedure is a  **Function** rather than a **Sub**. Make your procedure a **Sub**. An event handler can't return a value.
    
- Another [type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) uses the event name for a type of its own.
    
    Qualify the name with the name of the proper type library to avoid the ambiguity.
