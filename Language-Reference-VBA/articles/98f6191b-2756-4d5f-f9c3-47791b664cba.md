# Form already displayed; can't show modally (Error 400)

You can't use the  **Show** method to display a visible form as modal. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to use  **Show**, with the _style_[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) set to 1 - **vbModal**, on an already visible form.
    
    Use either the  **Unload** statement or the **Hide** method on the form before trying to show it as a modal form.
