# Const Statement

Declares [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for use in place of literal values.

 **Syntax**

[ **Public** |**Private** ] **Const**_constname_ [ **As**_type_ ] **=**_expression_

The  **Const** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Public**|Optional. [Keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) used at[module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to declare constants that are available to all[procedures](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in all[modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Not allowed in procedures.|
|**Private**|Optional. Keyword used at module level to declare constants that are available only within the module where the [declaration](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is made. Not allowed in procedures.|
| _constname_|Required. Name of the constant; follows standard [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) naming conventions.|
| _type_|Optional. [Data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the constant; may be[Byte](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Boolean](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Currency](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Single](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Double](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Decimal](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (not currently supported),[Date](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Use a separate  **As**_type_ clause for each constant being declared.|
| _expression_|Required. Literal, other constant, or any combination that includes all arithmetic or logical operators except  **Is**.|
 **Remarks**
Constants are private by default. Within procedures, constants are always private; their visibility can't be changed. In [standard modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the default visibility of module-level constants can be changed using the  **Public** keyword. In[class modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), however, constants can only be private and their visibility can't be changed using the  **Public** keyword.
To combine several constant declarations on the same line, separate each constant assignment with a comma. When constant declarations are combined in this way, the  **Public** or **Private** keyword, if used, applies to all of them.
You can't use variables, user-defined functions, or intrinsic Visual Basic functions (such as  **Chr** ) in[expressions](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) assigned to constants.

 **Note**  Constants can make your programs self-documenting and easy to modify. Unlike variables, constants can't be inadvertently changed while your program is running.

If you don't explicitly declare the constant type using  **As**_type_, the constant has the data type that is most appropriate for _expression_.
Constants declared in a  **Sub**, **Function**, or **Property** procedure are local to that procedure. A constant declared outside a procedure is defined throughout the module in which it is declared. You can use constants anywhere you can use an expression.

## Example

This example uses the  **Const** statement to declare constants for use in place of literal values. **Public** constants are declared in the General section of a standard module, rather than a class module. **Private** constants are declared in the General section of any type of module.


```
' Constants are Private by default. 
Const MyVar = 459 
 
' Declare Public constant. 
Public Const MyString = "HELP" 
 
' Declare Private Integer constant. 
Private Const MyInt As Integer = 5 
 
' Declare multiple constants on same line. 
Const MyStr = "Hello", MyDouble As Double = 3.4567 

```
