# Expected array

A [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) name with a subscript indicates the variable is an[array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- The syntax you specified is appropriate for an array, but no array with this name is in [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Check to make sure the name of the variable is spelled correctly. Unless the [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) contains **Option Explicit**, a variable is created on first use. If you misspell the name of an array variable, the variable may be created, but not as an array.
