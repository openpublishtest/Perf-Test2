# For control variable already in use

When you nest  **For...Next** loops, you must use different control[variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in each one. This error has the following cause and solution:



- An inner  **For** loop uses the same counter as an enclosing **For** loop. Check nested loops for repetition. For example, if the outer loop uses `For Count = 1 To 25`, the inner loops can't use  `Count` as the control variables.
