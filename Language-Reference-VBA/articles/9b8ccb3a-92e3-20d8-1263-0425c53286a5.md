# Object module must implement all procedures in interface

An interface is a collection of unimplemented [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) prototypes. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You specified an interface in an  **Implements** statement, but you didn't add code for all the procedures in the interface. You must write code for each of the procedures specified in the interface. An empty procedure is adequate; the procedure should implement the required behavior.
