# Assignment to constant not permitted
A constant represents a read-only value. This error has the following causes and solutions:


- You tried to assign a new value to a variable declared with  **Const**, or to a type library constant. If you need to assign a new value, declare an ordinary variable of the type desired and assign your value to that variable. If you need a variable with a restricted set of values, you can declare an enumeration, using the **Enum** statement.
