||-1 True. Indicates the item is selected.|
||0 False. Indicates the item is cleared.|
|**OptionButton**|Same as  **CheckBox**.|
|**ToggleButton**|Same as  **CheckBox**.|
|**ScrollBar**|An integer between the values specified for the  **Max** and **Min** properties.|
|**SpinButton**|Same as  **ScrollBar**.|
|**ComboBox, ListBox**|The value in the  **BoundColumn** of the currently selected rows.|

||Zero (0) indicates the first page. The maximum value is one less than the number of pages.|

 **Remarks**
 **BoundValue** applies to the control that has the focus.
The contents of the  **BoundValue** and **Value** properties are identical most of the time. When the user edits a control so that its value changes, the contents of **BoundValue** and **Value** are different until the change is final.
Several things occur when the user changes the value of a control. For example, if a user changes the text in a  **TextBox**, the following things occur:


1. The  **Change** event is initiated. At this time the **Value** property contains the new text and **BoundValue** contains the previous text.
    
2. The  **BeforeUpdate** event is initiated.
    
3. The  **AfterUpdate** event is initiated. The values for **BoundValue** and **Value** are once again identical, containing the new text.
    

 **BoundValue** cannot be used with a multi-select list box.
