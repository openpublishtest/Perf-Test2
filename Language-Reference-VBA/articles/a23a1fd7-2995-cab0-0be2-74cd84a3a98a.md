# Warning: custom language settings not portable

Not all language settings are portable. This warning has the following cause and solution:



- You used a custom language setting in your code. When you choose a custom language/country setting for your code, the language conventions used in your code match those set in the  **Control Panel** of your system. You can use custom code[locale](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) settings, but your code may not work in other locales or on other systems with different settings. The[host application](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) parses some strings based on the **Control Panel** settings of the machine on which it is running. If the **Control Panel** settings on the target machine aren't the same as those on the machine on which the code was written, strings parsed by a host application don't work, for example, code that depends on a locale-specific decimal separator. Therefore, you should not use a custom language setting unless you don't intend to send your code to other users. If you plan to send your code to other users, select a predefined locale.
