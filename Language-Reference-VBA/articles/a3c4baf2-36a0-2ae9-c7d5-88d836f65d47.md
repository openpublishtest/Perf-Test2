# Close Statement

Concludes input/output (I/O) to a file opened using the  **Open** statement.

 **Syntax**

 **Close** [ _filenumberlist_ ]

The optional  _filenumberlist_[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can be one or more[file numbers](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) using the following syntax, where _filenumber_ is any valid file number:
[[ **#** ] _filenumber_ ] [ **,** [ **#** ] _filenumber_ ] **. . .**
 **Remarks**
If you omit  _filenumberlist_, all active files opened by the **Open** statement are closed.
When you close files that were opened for  **Output** or **Append**, the final buffer of output is written to the operating system buffer for that file. All buffer space associated with the closed file is released.
When the  **Close** statement is executed, the association of a file with its file number ends.

## Example

This example uses the  **Close** statement to close all three files opened for **Output**.


```
Dim I, FileName 
For I = 1 To 3 ' Loop 3 times. 
 FileName = "TEST" &amp; I ' Create file name. 
 Open FileName For Output As #I ' Open file. 
 Print #I, "This is a test." ' Write string to file. 
Next I 
Close ' Close all 3 open files. 

```
