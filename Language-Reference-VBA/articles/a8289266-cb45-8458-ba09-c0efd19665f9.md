# Parent Propertya (Microsoft Forms)



Returns the name of the form, object, or [collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that contains a specific control, object, or collection.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Parent**
The  **Parent** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
 **Parent** is read-only.
Use the  **Parent** property to access the properties, methods, or controls of an object's parent.
This property is useful in an application in which you pass objects as arguments. For example, you could pass a control variable to a general procedure in a [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and use  **Parent** to access its parent form.
