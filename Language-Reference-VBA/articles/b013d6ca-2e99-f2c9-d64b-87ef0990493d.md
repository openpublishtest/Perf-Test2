# Function marked as restricted or uses a type not supported in Visual Basic

Not every [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that appears in a[type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can be accessed by every programming language. The creator of a type or object library can designate some functions as restricted to prevent their use by macro languages. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to use a function with a restricted specification. You can't use the function in your program. If you have documentation for the object represented by the library, check to see if a [method](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is provided that gives equivalent functionality.
    
- You tried to use a function that requires a [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) type or has a return type that isn't available in Visual Basic.
    
    Sometimes you can simulate return types with Visual Basic equivalents. Check the subtypes of the [Variant data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) . This may also work for non-Basic parameter types that are expected as references. However, you can't pass a **Variant** data type[by value](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in an effort to simulate a non-Basic type.
