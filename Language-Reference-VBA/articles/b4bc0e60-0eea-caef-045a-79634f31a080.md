# Can't place conditional breakpoint on an array

An [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) has no single value associated with it. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to set a conditional [breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (sometimes called a watchpoint) that would suspend program execution when the value of a whole array changed.
    
    Set the conditional breakpoint on a specific element of the array.
