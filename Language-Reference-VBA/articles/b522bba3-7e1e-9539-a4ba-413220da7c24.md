# Specified ActiveX component not correctly registered or not found

A component should be registered in the system [registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- The component's registry information is incorrect, so the component can't be found. Correct the registry. Reinstall the component, if necessary.
    
- The component was removed by deleting it instead of using an uninstall program. Replace the component files in the directory specified in the registry.
