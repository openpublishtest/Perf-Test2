# Selected watch expression invalid

It isn't always possible to select a valid [watch expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You chose the  **Instant Watch** command, but the selected[expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) isn't a valid expression. For example, you can't watch a[comment](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or a **Sub** procedure call.
    
    Select the expression in such a way that it is valid, or choose  **Add Watch** and type in a valid expression.
    
- The watch expression must have code syntax corresponding to the [locale](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the[project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that defines the expression being watched.
    
    Rewrite the expression in a way that is valid for the locale.
