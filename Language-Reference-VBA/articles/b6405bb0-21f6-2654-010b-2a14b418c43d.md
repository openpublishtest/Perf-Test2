# Initialize Event



Occurs after an object is loaded, but before it's shown.
 **Syntax**
 **Private Sub**_object_**_Initialize()**
The  _object_ placeholder represents an[object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.
 **Remarks**
The Initialize event is typically used to prepare an application or  **UserForm** for use.[Variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are assigned initial values, and controls may be moved or resized to accommodate initialization data.

## Example

The following example assumes two  **UserForms** in a program. In UserForm1's Initialize event, UserForm2 is loaded and shown. When the user clicks UserForm2, it is hidden and UserForm1 appears. When UserForm1 is clicked, UserForm2 is shown again.


```
' This is the Initialize event procedure for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    Load UserForm2
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub
' This is the Click event of UserForm2
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm2.Hide
End Sub

' This is the click event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    UserForm2.Show
End Sub

```
