An attempt was made to write to a write-protected disk or to access a locked file. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You tried to open a write-protected file for sequential  **Output** or **Append**. Open the file for **Input** or change the write-protection attribute of the file.
    
- You tried to open a file on a disk that is write-protected for sequential  **Output** or **Append**. Remove the write-protection device from the disk or open the file for **Input**.
    
- You tried to write to a file that another process locked. Wait to open the file until the other process releases it.
    
- You attempted to access the [registry](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but your user permissions don't include this type of registry access.
    
    On 32-bit Microsoft Windows systems, a user must have the correct permissions for access to the system registry. Change your permissions or have them changed by the system administrator.
