# Controls Collection (Microsoft Forms)



Includes all the controls contained in an object.
 **Remarks**
Each control in the  **Controls** collection of an object has a unique index whose value can be either an integer or a string. The index value for the first control in a[collection](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is 0; the value for the second control is 1, and so on. This value indicates the order in which controls were added to the collection.
If the index is a string, it represents the name of the control. The  **Name** property of a control also specifies a control's name.
You can use the  **Controls** collection to enumerate or count individual controls, and to set their properties. For example, you can enumerate the **Controls** collection of a particular form and set the **Height** property of each control to a specified value.

 **Note**  The For Each...Next statement is useful for enumerating a collection.
