# Seek failed: can't read/write from the disk

 **Seek** statements are carried out directly to disk. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You attempted to read from a disk or file that is write-protected, read-only, or locked. Remove the write-protected attribute or change the read-only attribute or lock. Note that if the file is locked by another process, you can't remove the lock.
    
- The file has become unavailable, for example, if a removable disk has been physically changed. If the file has been moved to another disk, access it from there. Otherwise, you can't access the file.
    
- You attempted to read from a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) file, an[object library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or a [type library](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but the file has been corrupted.
    
    Obtain a new copy of the library or project file.
