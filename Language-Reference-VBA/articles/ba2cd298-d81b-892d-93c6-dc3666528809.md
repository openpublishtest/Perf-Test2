# What is a shortcut menu?

A shortcut menu is a menu that appears when you right-click an object. In Microsoft Forms, the following objects have shortcut menus:



- The Toolbox, each page in the Toolbox, and each item on a page of the Toolbox.
    
- Individual controls on a form.
    
- Groups of controls (groups created with the  **Group** command).
    
- [Containers](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (such as UserForm).
    
- Individual  **Page** objects in a **MultiPage**.
    
- Individual  **Tab** objects in a **TabStrip**.
    
- Multiple controls that aren't in a group.
    

The commands on a shortcut menu vary depending on the object you select. For example, if you select multiple controls that aren't in a group, the shortcut menu will include the  **Group** command; the shortcut menu for the Toolbox will not.
To display the shortcut menu for a control or container, right-click the object.
