# Private Enum and user-defined types cannot be used as parameters or return types for public procedures, public data members, or fields of public user-defined types

A  **Public** procedure is visible to all[modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in a[project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), while a  **Private** **Enum** type is not visible outside its own module. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Your  **Public** procedure is in a **Public** class, but it returns a value or has a[parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that is defined in a[standard module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or in a **Private** class.
    
    Declare the  **Enum** **Public**. It must be in a[class module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
