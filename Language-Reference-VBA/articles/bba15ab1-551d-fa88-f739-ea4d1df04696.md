# Break Command (Run Menu)

Stops execution of a program while it's running and switches to [break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Any statement being executed when you choose this command is displayed in the  **Code** window with

Some editing changes made in break mode may require you to restart your program for the changes to take effect.
