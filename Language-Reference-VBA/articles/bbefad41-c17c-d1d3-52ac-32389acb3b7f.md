# Argument required for Property Let or Property Set

The purpose of  **Property Let** and **Property Set** procedures is to give a new value to a[property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following causes and solutions:



- In setting the property, the value doesn't appear in the right place. Place the value to which you want to set the property on the right side of the [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) setting the property value.
    
- In the procedure definition, the [parameter](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) defined to receive the value passed on the right side of the expression is missing or misplaced.
    
    Specify a parameter for the value argument list in the procedure definition. If the procedure takes more than one [argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the property-value parameter must appear last in the list.
