# #Const Directive

Used to define [conditional compiler constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for Visual Basic.

 **Syntax**

 **#Const**_constname_ = _expression_

The  **#Const** compiler directive syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _constname_|Required;  **Variant** ( **String** ). Name of the[constant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md); follows standard [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) naming conventions.|
| _expression_|Required. Literal, other conditional compiler constant, or any combination that includes any or all arithmetic or logical operators except  **Is**.|
 **Remarks**
Conditional compiler constants are always [Private](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to the[module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) in which they appear. It is not possible to create[Public](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) compiler constants using the **#Const** directive. **Public** compiler constants can only be created in the user interface.
Only conditional compiler constants and literals can be used in  _expression_. Using a standard constant defined with **Const**, or using a constant that is undefined, causes an error to occur. Conversely, constants defined using the **#Const**[keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can only be used for conditional compilation.
Conditional compiler constants are always evaluated at the [module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), regardless of their placement in code.

## Example

This example uses the  **#Const** directive to declare conditional compiler constants for use in **#If...#Else...#End If** constructs.


```
#Const DebugVersion = 1 ' Will evaluate true in #If block. 

```
