# Call Stack Command (View Menu)

Displays the  **Call Stack** dialog box, which lists the procedures that have started but are not completed. Available only in[break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

When Visual Basic is executing the code in a procedure, that procedure is added to a list of active procedure calls. If that procedure then calls another procedure, there are two procedures on the list of active procedure calls. Each time a procedure calls another [Sub](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Function](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or  **Property** procedure, it is added to the list. Each procedure is removed from the list as execution is returned to the calling procedure. Procedures called from the **Immediate** window are also added to the calls list.

You can also display the  **Call Stack** dialog box by clicking the **Calls** button (...) next to the Procedure box in the **Locals** window.
