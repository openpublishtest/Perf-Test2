Not all types of data can be assigned to [constants](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). This error has the following cause and solution:



- You tried to declare the type of a constant to be a [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), an object, or an [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
    Remove the declaration or redeclare as a [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
