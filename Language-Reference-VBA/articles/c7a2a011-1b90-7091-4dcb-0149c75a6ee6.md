# AvailableSpace Property



 **Description**
Returns the amount of space available to a user on the specified drive or network share.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **AvailableSpace**
The  _object_ is always a **Drive** object.
 **Remarks**
The value returned by the  **AvailableSpace** property is typically the same as that returned by the **FreeSpace** property. Differences may occur between the two values for computer systems that support quotas.
The following code illustrates the use of the  **AvailableSpace** property:



```
Sub ShowAvailableSpace(drvPath)
    Dim fs, d, s
    Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set d = fs.GetDrive(fs.GetDriveName(drvPath))
    s = "Drive " &amp; UCase(drvPath) &amp; " - " 
    s = s &amp; d.VolumeName  &amp; vbCrLf
    s = s &amp; "Available Space: " &amp; FormatNumber(d.AvailableSpace/1024, 0) 
    s = s &amp; " Kbytes"
    MsgBox s
End Sub

```
