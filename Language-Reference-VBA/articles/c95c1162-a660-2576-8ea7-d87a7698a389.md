# 'Item' could not be loaded. Remove it from the list of available add-ins?

Visual Basic couldn't load the [add-in](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that you tried to select from the **Available Add-Ins** list in the **Add-In Manager** dialog box. Click **Yes** to remove it from the list or click **No** to leave it on the list. In either case, you can't load it.
