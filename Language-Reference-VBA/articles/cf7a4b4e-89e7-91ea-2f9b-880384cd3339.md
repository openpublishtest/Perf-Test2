Searches the active [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for a specified string.
 **Syntax**
 _object_**.Find(**_target_, _startline_, _startcol_, _endline_, _endcol_ [, _wholeword_ ] [, _matchcase_ ] [, _patternsearch_ ] **) As Boolean**
The  **Find** syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. An [object expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that evaluates to an object in the Applies To list.|
| _target_|Required. A [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing the text or pattern you want to find.|
| _startline_|Required. A [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) specifying the line at which you want to start the search; will be set to the line of the match if one is found. The first line is number 1.|
| _startcol_|Required. A  **Long** specifying the column at which you want to start the search; will be set to the column containing the match if one is found. The first column is 1.|
| _endline_|Required. A  **Long** specifying the last line of the match if one is found. The last line may be specified as -1.|
| _endcol_|Required. A  **Long** specifying the last line of the match if one is found. The last column may be designated as -1.|
| _wholeword_|Optional. A [Boolean](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) value specifying whether to only match whole words. If **True**, only matches whole words. **False** is the default.|
| _matchcase_|Optional. A  **Boolean** value specifying whether to match case. If **True**, the search is case sensitive. **False** is the default.|
| _patternsearch_|Optional. A  **Boolean** value specifying whether or not the target string is a regular expression pattern. If **True**, the target string is a regular expression pattern. **False** is the default.|
 **Remarks**
 **Find** returns **True** if a match is found and **False** if a match isn't found.
The  _matchcase_ and _patternsearch_[arguments](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are mutually exclusive; if both arguments are passed as **True**, an error occurs.
The content of the  **Find** dialog box isn't affected by the **Find** method.
The specified range of lines and columns is inclusive, so a search can find the pattern on the specified last line if  _endcol_ is supplied as either -1 or the length of the line.
