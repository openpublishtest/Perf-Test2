# Object Data Type

[Object variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) are stored as 32-bit (4-byte) addresses that refer to objects. Using the **Set** statement, a variable declared as an **Object** can have any object reference assigned to it.


 **Note**  Although a variable declared with  **Object** type is flexible enough to contain a reference to any object, binding to the object referenced by that variable is always late ([run-time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) binding). To force early binding ([compile-time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) binding), assign the object reference to a variable declared with a specific[class](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) name.
