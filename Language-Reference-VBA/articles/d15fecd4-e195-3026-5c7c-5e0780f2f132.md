# Name Property Example

The following example displays the  **Name** property of each control on a form. This example uses the **Controls** collection to cycle through all the controls placed directly on the Userform.

To use this example, copy this sample code to the Declarations portion of a form. Make sure that the form contains a  **CommandButton** named CommandButton1 and several other controls.



```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click() 
 Dim MyControl As Control 
 
 For Each MyControl In Controls 
 MsgBox "MyControl.Name = " &amp; MyControl.Name 
 Next 
End Sub
```
