# Type-declaration character does not match declared data type

The [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can't be changed by appending the[type-declaration character](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for another type. This error has the following cause and solution:



- You declared a variable of a specific type, referenced a variable of the same name in the same [scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), and then appended an inconsistent type-declaration character.
    
    If you want to be able to change the type of data assigned to a variable, declare the variable as a  **Variant**. If you simply appended an incorrect type-declaration character, delete or change it.
