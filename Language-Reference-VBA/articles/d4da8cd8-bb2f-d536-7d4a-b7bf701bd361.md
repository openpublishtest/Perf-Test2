# Type-declaration character required

The necessity of using [type-declaration characters](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) depends on the form of the[identifier's](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) declaration. This error has the following cause and solution:



- A [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that was originally implicitly declared with a type-declaration characters was referenced without a type-declaration character. For example:
    
  ```
  MyStr$ = "Implicit declaration" 
MyStr = "Trying to refer to MyStr$, but error results" _ 
 &amp; "from calling it MyStr." 

  ```


  ```
  Dim MyStr$  
MyStr = "Because it was explicitly declared, the $ is optional." 

  ```


    Either make the declaration explicit, or add the type-declaration character to later references.
    
     **Note**  If an explicit variable declaration contains a type-declaration character, inclusion of the character is optional in later references. For example:
