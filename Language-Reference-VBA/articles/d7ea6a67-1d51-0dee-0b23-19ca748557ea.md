# Resize Event



Occurs when a user form is resized.
 **Syntax**
 **Private Sub UserForm_Resize()**
 **Remarks**
Use a Resize event [procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to move or resize[controls](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) when the parent **UserForm** is resized. You can also use this event procedure to recalculate[variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[properties](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).

## Example

The following example uses the Activate and Click events to illustrate triggering of the  **UserForm's** Resize event. As the user clicks the client area of the form, it grows or shrinks and the new height is specified in the title bar. Note that the **Tag** property is used to store the **UserForm's** initial height.


```
' Activate event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()
    UserForm1.Caption = "Click me to make me taller!"
    Tag = Height    ' Save the initial height.
End Sub

' Click event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Click()
    Dim NewHeight As Single
    NewHeight = Height
    ' If the form is small, make it tall.
    If NewHeight = Val(Tag) Then
        Height = Val(Tag) * 2
    Else
    ' If the form is tall, make it small.
        Height = Val(Tag)
    End If
End Sub

' Resize event for UserForm1
Private Sub UserForm_Resize()
    UserForm1.Caption = "New Height: " &amp; Height &amp; "  " &amp; "Click to resize me!"
End Sub


```
