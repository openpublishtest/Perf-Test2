# Expected variable or procedure, not project

There is no [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name in the current[scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but there is a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a project is used as a variable or procedure. Check the spelling of the variable or procedure name, and make sure the name you want to refer to isn't private to another [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). A project name can be a qualifier, but can't stand alone.
