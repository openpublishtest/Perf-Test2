# Automation object doesn't have a default value (Error 443)

When you specify an object name without a [property](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) or[method](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), Visual Basic assumes you are referencing the object's default [member](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (property or method). However, not all objects expose a default member. This error has the following cause and solution:



- Visual Basic can't determine the default member for the specified object. Check the object's documentation and give an explicit specification for the property or method.
