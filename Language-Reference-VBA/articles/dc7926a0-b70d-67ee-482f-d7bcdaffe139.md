# Array Function



Returns a [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) containing an[array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 **Syntax**
 **Array(**_arglist_**)**
The required  _arglist_[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is a comma-delimited list of values that are assigned to the elements of the array contained within the **Variant**. If no arguments are specified, an array of zero length is created.
 **Remarks**
The notation used to refer to an element of an array consists of the [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) name followed by parentheses containing an index number indicating the desired element. In the following example, the first[statement](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) creates a variable named `A` as a **Variant**. The second statement assigns an array to variable `A`. The last statement assigns the value contained in the second array element to another variable.



```
Dim A As Variant
A = Array(10,20,30)
B = A(2)

```

The lower bound of an array created using the  **Array** function is determined by the lower bound specified with the **Option Base** statement, unless **Array** is qualified with the name of the type library (for example **VBA.Array** ). If qualified with the type-library name, **Array** is unaffected by **Option Base**.

 **Note**  A  **Variant** that is not declared as an array can still contain an array. A **Variant** variable can contain an array of any type, except fixed-length strings and[user-defined types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Although a  **Variant** containing an array is conceptually different from an array whose elements are of type **Variant**, the array elements are accessed in the same way.


## Example

This example uses the  **Array** function to return a **Variant** containing an array.


```
Dim MyWeek, MyDay
MyWeek = Array("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")
' Return values assume lower bound set to 1 (using Option Base
' statement).
MyDay = MyWeek(2)    ' MyDay contains "Tue".
MyDay = MyWeek(4)    ' MyDay contains "Thu".
```
