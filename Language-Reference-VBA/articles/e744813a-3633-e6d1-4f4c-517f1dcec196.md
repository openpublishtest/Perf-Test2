## Example

This example uses the  **Loc** function to return the current read/write position within an open file. This example assumes that `TESTFILE` is a text file with a few lines of sample data.


```
Dim MyLocation, MyLine
Open "TESTFILE" For Binary As #1    ' Open file just created.
Do While MyLocation < LOF(1)    ' Loop until end of file.
    MyLine = MyLine &amp; Input(1, #1)    ' Read character into variable.
    MyLocation = Loc(1)    ' Get current position within file.
' Print to the Immediate window.
    Debug.Print MyLine; Tab; MyLocation
Loop
Close #1    ' Close file.

```
