# Expected variable or procedure, not Enum type

The name of an  **Enum** type only appears in a statement declaring an enumeration of the type or as a qualifier. This error has the following cause and solution:



- An  **Enum** type name is used instead of the name of an enumeration variable of the type. Declare a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of the **Enum** type or find a previous declaration in the current[scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and use that variable.
    
- An  **Enum** type name is used instead of a variable or[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) name.
    
    Check the spelling of the [identifier](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that caused the error. Use the name of a variable or procedure where you specified an **Enum** type.
