# Stop Code Execution

As you run your code, it may stop executing for one of the following reasons:



- An untrapped [run-time error](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) occurs.
    
- A trapped run-time error occurs, and  **Break on All Errors** is selected on the **General** tab in the **Options** dialog box.
    
- A [breakpoint](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) is encountered.
    
- A  **Stop** statement is encountered in your code, switching the mode to[break mode](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
- An  **End** statement is encountered in your code, switching the mode to[design time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
    
- You halt execution manually at a given point.
    
- A [watch expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that you set to break if its value changes or becomes true is encountered.
