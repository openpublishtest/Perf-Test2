# Private Statement

Used at [module level](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) to declare private[variables](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) and allocate storage space.

 **Syntax**

 **Private** [ **WithEvents** ] _varname_ [ **(** [ _subscripts_ ] **)** ] [ **As** [ **New** ] _type_ ] [ **,** [ **WithEvents** ] _varname_ [ **(** [ _subscripts_ ] **)** ] [ **As** [ **New** ] _type_ ]] **. . .**

The  **Private** statement syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**WithEvents**|Optional. [Keyword](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) that specifies that _varname_ is an[object variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) used to respond to events triggered by an[ActiveX object](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).  **WithEvents** is valid only in[class modules](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). You can declare as many individual variables as you like using  **WithEvents**, but you can't create[arrays](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) with **WithEvents**. You can't use **New** with **WithEvents**.|
| _varname_|Required. Name of the variable; follows standard variable naming conventions.|
| _subscripts_|Optional. Dimensions of an array variable; up to 60 multiple dimensions may be declared. The  _subscripts_[argument](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) uses the following syntax:|
|
|[ _lower_**To** ] _upper_ [ **,** [ _lower_**To** ] _upper_ ] **. . .**|
|
|When not explicitly stated in  _lower_, the lower bound of an array is controlled by the **Option** **Base** statement. The lower bound is zero if no **Option** **Base** statement is present.|
|**New**|Optional. Keyword that enables implicit creation of an object. If you use  **New** when declaring the object variable, a new instance of the object is created on first reference to it, so you don't have to use the **Set** statement to assign the object reference. The **New** keyword can't be used to declare variables of any intrinsic[data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), can't be used to declare instances of dependent objects, and can't be used with  **WithEvents**.|
| _type_|Optional. Data type of the variable; may be [Byte](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Boolean](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Currency](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Single](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Double](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Decimal](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (not currently supported),[Date](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) (for variable-length strings), **String** * _length_ (for fixed-length strings),[Object](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), a [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or an [object type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Use a separate  **As**_type_ clause for each variable being defined.|
 **Remarks**
 **Private** variables are available only to the module in which they are declared.
Use the  **Private** statement to declare the data type of a variable. For example, the following statement declares a variable as an **Integer**:



```
Private NumberOfEmployees As Integer 

```

You can also use a  **Private** statement to declare the object type of a variable. The following statement declares a variable for a new instance of a worksheet.



```
Private X As New Worksheet 

```

If the  **New** keyword isn't used when declaring an object variable, the variable that refers to the object must be assigned an existing object using the **Set** statement before it can be used. Until it's assigned an object, the declared object variable has the special value **Nothing**, which indicates that it doesn't refer to any particular instance of an object.
If you don't specify a data type or object type, and there is no  **Def**_type_ statement in the module, the variable is **Variant** by default.
You can also use the  **Private** statement with empty parentheses to declare a dynamic array. After declaring a dynamic array, use the **ReDim** statement within a procedure to define the number of dimensions and elements in the array. If you try to redeclare a dimension for an array variable whose size was explicitly specified in a **Private**, **Public**, or **Dim** statement, an error occurs.
When variables are initialized, a numeric variable is initialized to 0, a variable-length string is initialized to a zero-length string (""), and a fixed-length string is filled with zeros.  **Variant** variables are initialized to[Empty](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md). Each element of a user-defined type variable is initialized as if it were a separate variable.

 **Note**  When you use the  **Private** statement in a procedure, you generally put the **Private** statement at the beginning of the procedure.


## Example

This example shows the  **Private** statement being used at the module level to declare variables as private; that is, they are available only to the module in which they are declared.


```
Private Number As Integer ' Private Integer variable. 
Private NameArray(1 To 5) As String ' Private array variable. 
' Multiple declarations, two Variants and one Integer, all Private. 
Private MyVar, YourVar, ThisVar As Integer 

```
