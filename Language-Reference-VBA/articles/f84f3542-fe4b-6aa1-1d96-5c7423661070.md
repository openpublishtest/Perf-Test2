# Expected user-defined type, not project

There is no [user-defined type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name in the current[scope](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), but there is a [project](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) by this name. You can define a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) as having user-defined type, but not project type. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a project is used as a user-defined type. Check the spelling of the name of the user-defined type, and make sure the user-defined type isn't private to another [module](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
