# Debug Object



The  **Debug** object has two methods, _.Print_ and _.Assert_. _.Print_ stringexpr sends stringexpr as output to the **Immediate** window at **Debug**[run time](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).
 _.Assert_ expression evaluates expression and, if true, breakpoints in the debugger.
