# + Operator



Used to sum two numbers.
 **Syntax**
 _result_**=**_expression1+expression2_
The  **+** operator syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _result_|Required; any numeric [variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| _expression1_|Required; any [expression](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md).|
| _expression2_|Required; any expression.|
 **Remarks**
When you use the  **+** operator, you may not be able to determine whether addition or string concatenation will occur. Use the **&amp;** operator for concatenation to eliminate ambiguity and provide self-documenting code.
If at least one expression is not a [Variant](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), the following rules apply:


|**If**|**Then**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Both expressions are [numeric data types](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) ([Byte](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Boolean](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Integer](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Long](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Single](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Double](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Date](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), [Currency](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), or [Decimal](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md))|Add.|
|Both expressions are [String](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)|Concatenate.|
|One expression is a numeric data type and the other is any  **Variant** except[Null](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md)|Add.|
|One expression is a  **String** and the other is any **Variant** except **Null**|Concatenate.|
|One expression is an [Empty ](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) **Variant**|Return the remaining expression unchanged as  _result_.|
|One expression is a numeric data type and the other is a  **String**|A  `Type mismatch`error occurs.|
|Either expression is  **Null**| _result_ is **Null**.|
If both expressions are  **Variant** expressions, the following rules apply:


|**If**|**Then**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Both  **Variant** expressions are numeric|Add.|
|Both  **Variant** expressions are strings|Concatenate.|
|One  **Variant** expression is numeric and the other is a string|Add.|
For simple arithmetic addition involving only expressions of numeric data types, the [data type](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) of _result_ is usually the same as that of the most precise expression. The order of precision, from least to most precise, is **Byte**, **Integer**, **Long**, **Single**, **Double**, **Currency**, and **Decimal**. The following are exceptions to this order:


|**If**|**Then  _result_ is**|
|:-----|:-----|
|A  **Single** and a **Long** are added,|a  **Double**.|
|The data type of  _result_ is a **Long**, **Single**, or **Date** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to a  **Double** variant.|
|The data type of  _result_ is a **Byte** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to an  **Integer** variant.|
|The data type of  _result_ is an **Integer** variant that overflows its legal range,|converted to a  **Long** variant.|
|A  **Date** is added to any data type,|a  **Date**.|
If one or both expressions are  **Null** expressions, _result_ is **Null**. If both expressions are **Empty**, _result_ is an **Integer**. However, if only one expression is **Empty**, the other expression is returned unchanged as _result_.

 **Note**  The order of precision used by addition and subtraction is not the same as the order of precision used by multiplication.


## Example

This example uses the  **+** operator to sum numbers. The **+** operator can also be used to concatenate strings. However, to eliminate ambiguity, you should use the **&amp;** operator instead. If the components of an expression created with the **+** operator include both strings and numerics, the arithmetic result is assigned. If the components are exclusively strings, the strings are concatenated.


```
Dim MyNumber, Var1, Var2
MyNumber = 2 + 2    ' Returns 4.
MyNumber = 4257.04 + 98112    ' Returns 102369.04.

Var1 = "34": Var2 = 6    ' Initialize mixed variables.
MyNumber = Var1 + Var2    ' Returns 40.

Var1 = "34": Var2 = "6"    ' Initialize variables with strings.
MyNumber = Var1 + Var2    ' Returns "346" (string concatenation).

```
