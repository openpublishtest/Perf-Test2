# Array already dimensioned

A static [array](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) can only be dimensioned once. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- You attempted to change the dimensions of a static array with a  **ReDim** statement; only dynamic arrays can be redimensioned. Either remove the redimensioning or use a dynamic array. To define a dynamic array, use a **Dim**, **Public**, **Private**, or **Static** statement with empty parentheses. For example: `Dim MyArray()` In a[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), you can define a dynamic array with the  **ReDim** or **Static** statement using a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the number of elements:
    
  ```
  Dim MyArray() 

  ```


  ```
  ReDim MyArray(n) 

  ```


     In a[procedure](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md), you can define a dynamic array with the  **ReDim** or **Static** statement using a[variable](b8bdf64f-5920-1ae9-16d0-b26d09524a30.md) for the number of elements: `ReDim MyArray(n)`
    
- An  **Option Base** statement occurs after array dimensions are set. Make sure any **Option Base** statement precedes all array declarations.
