## Syntax

 _expression_. **NotifySignatureAdded**( ** _ParentWindow_**, ** _psigsetup_**, ** _psiginfo_** )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **SignatureProvider** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ParentWindow_|Required|**IOleWindow**|Allows the host application to obtain the handle to the window containing the displayed dialog box.|
| _psigsetup_|Required|**SignatureSetup**|Contains initial settings of the signature provider.|
| _psiginfo_|Required|**SignatureInfo**|Contains information about the signature provider add-in.|

## Remarks

This method is called when the signing process has completed. Allows a signature provider add-in the ability to add additional functionality to the add-in. For example, if you wanted to offer an archive service where a user could upload their signed document, you could use this method to initiate that process.


## Example

The following example, written in C#, shows the implementation of the  **NotifySignatureAdded** method in a custom signature provider project.


```
 public void NotifySignatureAdded(object parentWindow, SignatureSetup sigsetup, SignatureInfo siginfo) 
 { 
 using (Win32WindowFromOleWindow window = new Win32WindowFromOleWindow(parentWindow)) 
 { 
 MessageBox.Show(window, "Signature has been applied", "Signing Ceremony", MessageBoxButtons.OK); 
 } 
 } 

```


 **Note**  Signature providers are implemented exclusively in custom COM add-ins and cannot be implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
