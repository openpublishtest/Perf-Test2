# CommandBarComboBox.ListIndex Property (Office)

Gets or sets the index number of the selected item in the list portion of the  **CommandBarComboBox** control. If nothing is selected in the list, this property returns zero. Read/write.


## 


 **Note**  The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, search Help for the keyword "ribbon."


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ListIndex**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandBarComboBox** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  This property fails when applied to controls other than list controls.

Setting the  **ListIndex** property causes the specified control to select the given item and execute the appropriate action in the application.


## Example

This example uses the  **ListIndex** property to determine the correct subroutine to run, based on the selection in the combo box on the command bar named "My Custom Bar." Because the procedure uses **ListIndex**, the text in the combo box can be anything.


```
Sub processSelection() 
Dim userChoice As Long 
userChoice = CommandBars("My Custom Bar").Controls(1).ListIndex 
    Select Case userChoice 
        Case 1 
            chartcourse 
        Case 2 
            displaygraph 
        Case Else 
            MsgBox ("Invalid choice. Please choose again.") 
    End Select 
End Sub
```
