# WorkflowTasks Object (Office)

Represents a collection of  **WorkflowTask** objects.


## Example

The following example displays the name of each workflow task in the current document and then displays the workflow task edit user interface for a specific task. It should be noted that calling the  **GetWorkflowTasks** method involves a round-trip to the server.


```
Sub DisplayWorkTask() 
Dim objWorkflowTasks As WorkflowTasks 
Dim objWorkflowTask As WorkflowTask 
Dim cnt As Integer 
 
Set objWorkflowTasks = Document.GetWorkflowTasks() 
 
For cnt = 1 To objWorkflowTasks.Count 
 Debug.Print objWorkflowTask(cnt).Name 
Next 
 
Set objWorkflowTask = objWorkflowTasks(1) 
objWorkflowTask.Show 
 
End Sub 

```
