The  **Creator** property always returns the numeric identifier for the active application, just as the **Application** property always returns the name of the active applicatin in string form. Use the **CreatedBy** property of the **SharedWorkspaceFile**, **SharedWorkspaceFolder**, **SharedWorkspaceLink**, and **SharedWorkspaceTask** objects to return the name of the individual who created those objects. Use document properties to return information about the authors of Office documents.
