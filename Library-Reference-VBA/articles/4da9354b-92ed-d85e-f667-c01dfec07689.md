# CommandBars.OnUpdate Event (Office)

Occurs when any change is made to a command bar.


## 


 **Note**  The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, search Help for the keyword "ribbon."


## Syntax

 _expression_. **OnUpdate**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandBars** object.


## Remarks

The  **OnUpdate** event is recognized by the **CommandBar** object and all command bar controls. The event is triggered by any change to a command bar or command bar control or any change to the state of a command bar or command bar control. These changes can occur due to a text or cell selection, for example. Since a large number of **OnUpdate** events can occur during normal usage, developers should exercise caution when using this event. It is strongly recommended that this event be used primarily for checking that a custom command bar has been added or removed by a COM AddIn.
