foundFlag =  False 
For i = 1 To CommandBars.Count 
    If CommandBars(i).Name = "Forms" Then 
            CommandBars(i).Protection = msoBarNoChangeDock 
            CommandBars(i).Visible = True  
            foundFlag = True  
    End If 
Next 
If Not foundFlag Then 
    MsgBox "'Forms' command bar is not in the collection." 
End If
