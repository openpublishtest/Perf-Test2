##

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ActionControl**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandBars** object.


## Example

This example creates a command bar named "Custom", adds three buttons to it, and then uses the  **ActionControl** property and the **Tag** property to determine which command bar button was last clicked.


```
Set myBar = CommandBars _ 
    .Add(Name:="Custom", Position:=msoBarTop, _ 
    Temporary:=True) 
Set buttonOne = myBar.Controls.Add(Type:=msoControlButton) 
With buttonOne 
    .FaceId = 133 
    .Tag = "RightArrow" 
    .OnAction = "whichButton" 
End With 
Set buttonTwo = myBar.Controls.Add(Type:=msoControlButton) 
With buttonTwo 
    .FaceId = 134 
    .Tag = "UpArrow" 
    .OnAction = "whichButton" 
End With 
Set buttonThree = myBar.Controls.Add(Type:=msoControlButton) 
With buttonThree 
    .FaceId = 135 
    .Tag = "DownArrow" 
    .OnAction = "whichButton" 
End With 
myBar.Visible = True
```

The following subroutine responds to the  **OnAction** method and determines which command bar button was last clicked.




```
Sub whichButton() 
Select Case CommandBars.ActionControl.Tag 
    Case "RightArrow" 
        MsgBox ("Right Arrow button clicked.") 
    Case "UpArrow" 
        MsgBox ("Up Arrow button clicked.") 
    Case "DownArrow" 
        MsgBox ("Down Arrow button clicked.") 
End Select 
End Sub
```
