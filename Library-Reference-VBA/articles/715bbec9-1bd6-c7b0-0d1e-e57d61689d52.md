## 


 **Note**  The use of CommandBars in some Microsoft Office applications has been superseded by the new ribbon component of the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface. For more information, search Help for the keyword "ribbon."


## Syntax

 _expression_. **DropDownLines**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandBarComboBox** object.


## Remarks


 **Note**  An error occurs if you attempt to set this property for a combo box control that's an edit box or a built-in combo box control.

If this property is set to 0 (zero), the number of lines in the control is based on the number of items in the list.


## Example

This example adds a combo box control containing two items to the command bar named "Custom". The example also sets the number of line items, the width of the combo box, and an empty default for the combo box.


```
Set myBar = CommandBars("Custom") 
Set myControl = myBar.Controls.Add(Type:=msoControlComboBox, Id:=1) 
With myControl 
    .AddItem Text:="First Item", Index:=1 
    .AddItem "Second Item", 2 
    .DropDownLines = 3 
    .DropDownWidth = 75 
    .ListHeaderCount = 0 
End With
```
