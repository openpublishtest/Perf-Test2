##

## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **CommandBarPopup** object.


## Remarks

Resetting a built-in control restores the actions originally intended for the control and resets each of the control's properties back to its original state. 


## Example

The following example searches all command bars for a CommandBarPopup object whose tag is "Graphics" and then resets it to its default state.


```
Set myControl = Application.CommandBars.FindControl _ 
(Type:=msoControlPopup, Tag:="Graphics")  
myControl.Reset 

```
