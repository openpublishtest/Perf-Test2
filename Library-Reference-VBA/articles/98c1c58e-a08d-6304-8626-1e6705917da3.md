# CustomXMLParts Object (Office)

Represents a collection of  **CustomXMLPart** objects.


## Remarks

There are three default parts that are always created with a document. These are 'Cover pages', 'Doc properties' and 'App properties'. The last two were in previous versions of Microsoft Word but are now provided in XML form in the  **CustomXMLParts** object collection


## Example

The following example adds a node to a  **CustomXMLPart** object that is part of the **CustomXMLParts** object collection.


```
Sub AddPartToCollection() 
    Dim myPart As CustomXMLPart 
 
    Set myPart = ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts.Add("<author>Mark Twain</author>") 
     
End Sub
```
