## Methods



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[AppendChildNode](3fbe1c76-b60a-e365-4988-4a94a52e1fe0.md)|Appends a single node as the last child under the context element node in the tree. |
|[AppendChildSubtree](67899ba9-7e5a-e40e-2e33-b02ff1fff4b4.md)|Adds a subtree as the last child under the context element node in the tree.|
|[Delete](e240dea8-3045-634d-1ac8-782facf85d4e.md)|Deletes the current node from the tree (including all of its children, if any exist).|
|[HasChildNodes](9afc3116-372c-7efa-8cdd-04f87d903cc2.md)|Gets  **True** if the current element node has child element nodes.|
|[InsertNodeBefore](b2805906-16b7-aebd-ccde-ded736a1b69b.md)|Inserts a new node just before the context node in the tree.|
|[InsertSubtreeBefore](5d9e9303-e427-a092-3960-eee90a53970d.md)|Inserts the specified subtree into the location just before the context node. |
|[RemoveChild](dc6c380a-6cfd-870a-9a31-d92aed1ae3e1.md)|Removes the specified child node from the tree.|
|[ReplaceChildNode](72d571f4-8a54-b250-ce5d-22d595ef09f4.md)|Removes the specified child node (and its subtree) from the main tree, and replaces it with a different node in the same location.|
|[ReplaceChildSubtree](955ec2ab-c6c9-242c-5e05-3ff03b00b120.md)|Removes the specified node (and its subtree) from the main tree, and replaces it with a different subtree in the same location.|
|[SelectNodes](443592af-a684-ee5e-98af-3e157f0f135e.md)|Selects a collection of nodes matching an XPath expression. This method differs from the  **CustomXMLPart**. **SelectNodes** method in that the XPath expression will be evaluated starting with the 'expression' node as the context node.|
|[SelectSingleNode](630751f0-fe41-8f91-32d0-e266b3214cbf.md)|Selects a single node from a collection matching an XPath expression. This method differs from the  **CustomXMLPart**. **SelectSingleNode** method in that the XPath expression will be evaluated starting with the 'expression' node as the context node.|
