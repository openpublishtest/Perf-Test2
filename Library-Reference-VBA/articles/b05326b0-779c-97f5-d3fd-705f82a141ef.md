# DocumentInspector.Fix Method (Office)

## Syntax

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **DocumentInspector** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Status_|Required|**MsoDocInspectorStatus**|An enumeration representing that staus of the document.  _Status_ is an output parameter, which means that its value is returned when the method has completed its purpose.|
| _Results_|Required|**String**|Contains the results of the action.  _Results_ is an output parameter.|

## Remarks

 **MsoDocInspectorStatus** members

There are two Document Inspector modules that are included with Microsoft Office. These are the  **Comments/Revisions** module and the **Document Properties** method. These are the first two options that show up in the **Document Inspector** dialog box but are not available in the **DocumentInspectors** collection.


## Example

The following example demonstrates implementing the  **Fix** method of the **DocumentInspector** object. You specify which Document Inspector module to execute with the index value specified in the **DocumentInspectors** collection. Before executing this method, you would likely run the **Inspect** method to determine if there are any hidden worksheets in the workbook.


```
Public Sub DI_FixDocument() 
Dim docStatus As MsoDocInspectorStatus 
Dim result As String 
ActiveDocument.DocumentInspectors(3).Fix docStatus, result 
 
MsgBox ("The Fix method returned the following status " &amp; docStatus &amp; _ 
" with this result " &amp; result) 
End Sub
```
