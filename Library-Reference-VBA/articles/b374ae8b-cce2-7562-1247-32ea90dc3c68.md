```
Set myBar = CommandBars("Custom") 
barHeight = myBar.Height 
Set myControl = myBar.Controls _ 
    .Add(Type:=msoControlButton, _ 
    Id:= CommandBars("Standard").Controls("Save").Id, _ 
     Temporary:=True) 
With myControl 
    .Height = barHeight * 2 
    .Width = 50 
End With 
myBar.Visible = True
```
