# WebPageFont.ProportionalFontSize Property (Office)

Sets or gets the proportional font size setting in the host application, in points. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ProportionalFontSize**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **WebPageFont** object.


## Remarks

When you set the  **ProportionalFontSize** property, the host application does not check the value for validity. If you enter an invalid value, such as a nonnumber, the host application sets the size to 0 points. You can enter half-point sizes; if you enter other fractional point sizes, they are rounded up or down to the nearest half-point.


## Example

This example sets the proportional font and proportional font size for the English/Western European/Other Latin Script character set in the active application.


```
Application.DefaultWebOptions. _ 
Fonts(msoCharacterSetEnglishWesternEuropeanOtherLatinScript) _ 
.ProportionalFont = "Tahoma" 
Application.DefaultWebOptions. _ 
Fonts(msoCharacterSetEnglishWesternEuropeanOtherLatinScript) _ 
.ProportionalFontSize = 14.5
```
