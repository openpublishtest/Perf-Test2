# SharedWorkspaceLink Object (Office)

Represents a URL link saved in a shared document workspace site.


 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Office 2010, this object or member has been deprecated and should not be used.


## Remarks

Use the  **SharedWorkspaceLink** object to manage links to additional documents and information of interest to the members who are collaborating on the documents in the shared workspace site.

Use the  **Item** ( _index_ ) property of the **SharedWorkspaceLinks** collection to return a specific **SharedWorkspaceLink** object.

Use the  **Description** property to set the link description that appears on the **Links** tab of the **Shared Workspace** pane and on the workspace Web page. Use the **URL** property to set the destination address of the link. Use the **Notes** property to supply additional information about the link.

Use the  **Save** method to upload changes to the server after you modify properties of the **SharedWorkspaceLink** object.

Use the  **CreatedBy**, **CreatedDate**, **ModifiedBy**, and **ModifiedDate** properties to return information about the history of each link.


## Example

The following example modifies the first link in the shared workspace site to point to the Microsoft Developer Network home page, then uploads the changes to the server.


```
    Dim swsLink As Office.SharedWorkspaceLink 
    Set swsLink = ActiveWorkbook.SharedWorkspace.Links(1) 
    With swsLink 
        .Description = "MSDN Home Page" 
        .URL = "http://msdn.microsoft.com/" 
        .Notes = "My favorite site for developers!" 
        .Save 
    End With 
    Set swsLink = Nothing 

```
