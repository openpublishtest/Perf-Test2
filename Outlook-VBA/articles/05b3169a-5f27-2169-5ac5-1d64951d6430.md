# Explorer.SelectAllItems Method (Outlook)

Selects all items that are contained in the current view of the active explorer. 


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **SelectAllItems**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **[Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

If one or more groups are collapsed in the current view, calling  **SelectAllItems** does not select items in the collapsed groups. Only items in expanded groups are selected.

If the current view is a calendar view, calling  **SelectAllItems** selects all appointments and all-day events in the view. Calling **SelectAllItems** on a calendar view does not select items in the Daily Task List.

The  **[SelectionChange](ef0d976f-b9f6-2080-7657-e48d1c64ccb1.md)** event fires only once after the **SelectAllItems** method is called.

If the current view or current folder does not contain any items, calling  **SelectAllItems** does not result in any change to the selection and does not fire the **SelectionChange** event.

 **SelectAllItems** raises an error if the item is being edited in the current view, or the current view is a conversation view.
