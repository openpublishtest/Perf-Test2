## Example

This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example uses  **[CreateItem](e5fbf367-db16-5042-823e-68e6b805e612.md)** to create an **[AppointmentItem](204a409d-654e-27aa-643a-8344c631b82d.md)** object. The **[RecurrencePattern](36c098f7-59fb-879a-5173-ed0260d13fa4.md)** is obtained for this item using the **[GetRecurrencePattern](a9f67c5b-a77f-4e34-e654-d12560a6dba0.md)** method. By setting the these properties: **[RecurrenceType](bc9b35b5-ef00-e5cf-09cc-ee8743efddcf.md)** , **[PatternStartDate](20c82dbd-a622-91b6-618c-7cbe8bff2ca7.md)** , and **[PatternEndDate](0f78ea71-3d92-2d38-be10-e05ab7bcf44a.md)** , the appointments are now a recurring series that occur on a daily basis for the period of one year. An **[Exception](010552b0-9ba6-c81b-1e3a-fd6a681e5163.md)** object is created when one instance of this recurring appointment is obtained using the **[GetOccurrence](2a0cd7d2-d16d-7b07-eb5d-43df0bbf022f.md)** method and properties for this instance are altered. This exception to the series of appointments is obtained using the **GetRecurrencePattern** method to access the **[Exceptions](fa3b6c2e-33b0-0f04-4e60-af2c582f2caa.md)** collection associated with this series. Message boxes display the original **[Subject](57f0f242-6d04-175f-4ea2-25145787f5bd.md)** and **[OriginalDate](0777de75-b32d-fe23-03d8-bb3deb18a69e.md)** for this exception to the series of appointments and the current date, time, and subject for this exception.
