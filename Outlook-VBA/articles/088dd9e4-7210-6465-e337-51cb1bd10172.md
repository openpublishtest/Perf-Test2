# OlkFrameHeader Object (Outlook)

A control that provides a separator between sections in a form.


## Remarks

Before you use this control for the first time in the forms designer, add the Microsoft Outlook Frame Header Control to the control toolbox. You can only add this control to a form region in an Outlook form using the forms designer; you cannot add this control to a Visual Basic  **UserForm** object in the Visual Basic Editor.

The following is an example of a frame header control at runtime. This control supports Microsoft Windows themes.
