# OptionButton.Locked Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that specifies whether a control can be edited. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Locked**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **OptionButton** object.


## Remarks

 **True** represents that the value of the control cannot be edited. **False** represents that the value can be edited (default).

When a control is locked and enabled, it can still initiate events and can still receive the focus.

The  **[Enabled](3e10fee4-057d-40f7-015b-8d3e1138c1af.md)** and **Locked** properties work together to achieve the following effects:


- If  **Enabled** and **Locked** are both **True**, the control can receive focus and appears normally (not dimmed) in the form. The user can copy, but not edit, data in the control.
    
- If  **Enabled** is **True** and **Locked** is **False**, the control can receive focus and appears normally in the form. The user can copy and edit data in the control.
    
- If  **Enabled** is **False** and **Locked** is **True**, the control cannot receive focus and is dimmed in the form. The user can neither copy nor edit data in the control.
    
- If  **Enabled** and **Locked** are both **False**, the control cannot receive focus and is dimmed in the form. The user can neither copy nor edit data in the control.
