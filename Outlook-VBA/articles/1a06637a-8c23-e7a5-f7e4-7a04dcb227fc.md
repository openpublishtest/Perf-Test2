 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ListBox** object.


## Remarks

 **ListCount** is the number of rows over which you can scroll. **ListCount** is always one greater than the largest value for the **[ListIndex](c3eb93ea-bc47-6c2c-f80d-c9b53f797ef3.md)** property, because index numbers begin with 0 and the count of items begins with 1. If no item is selected, **ListCount** is 0 and **ListIndex** is -1.
