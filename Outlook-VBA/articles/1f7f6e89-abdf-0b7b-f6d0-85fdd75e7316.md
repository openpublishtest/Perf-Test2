# Creating a Reply Form

When you create a message form, you often want users to send a reply by using a reply form.

An Action automatically opens a reply form, typically after a user clicks  **Reply**,  **Forward**, or another command on the form. For example, an Action can create a  **Forward** button, that, when selected by the user, opens a forward form for the user to fill in and send. You can specify that the form use standard **Reply** and **Forward** headers, and you can even add prefix text, such as "RE:," to the **Subject** field of your custom reply form.

You can use the default reply forms included with Microsoft Outlook (these are the forms listed on the  **Actions** page), or you can disable any of these forms and create a custom reply form. (For more information, see [How to: Disable a Standard Reply Form?](b1a3f8fc-6400-9ae8-dab2-a4875ccaf92b.md)) The custom reply forms that you create are listed on the  **Actions** page in design mode in the form.

You can create custom buttons and menu commands and specify what happens when the user selects them. You can also create a button or menu command that opens a task, a Calendar item, or even a note.
You can send information without opening a reply form by pre-addressing a custom reply form to go to a specific e-mail address or to a public folder.
