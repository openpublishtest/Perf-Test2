# AppointmentItem Object (Outlook)

Represents a meeting, a one-time appointment, or a recurring appointment or meeting in the Calendar folder.


## Remarks

Use the  **[CreateItem](e5fbf367-db16-5042-823e-68e6b805e612.md)** method to create an **AppointmentItem** object that represents a new appointment.

Use  **[Items](89a031e0-c0a3-fc22-f485-189df8db45f4.md)** ( _index_ ), where _index_ is the index number of an appointment or a value used to match the default property of an appointment, to return a single **AppointmentItem** object from a Calendar folder.

You can also return an  **AppointmentItem** object from a **[MeetingItem](b75730f5-b395-3d66-5acd-b64fd8fcd78f.md)** object by using the **[GetAssociatedAppointment](8344d40d-5c1d-ead3-87cb-fd795b831712.md)** method.

When you work with recurring appointment items, you should release any prior references, obtain new references to the recurring appointment item before you access or modify the item, and release these references as soon as you are finished and have saved the changes. This practice applies to the recurring  **AppointmentItem** object, and any **[Exception](010552b0-9ba6-c81b-1e3a-fd6a681e5163.md)** or **[RecurrencePattern](36c098f7-59fb-879a-5173-ed0260d13fa4.md)** object. To release a reference in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or Visual Basic, set that existing object to **Nothing** . In C#, explicitly release the memory for that object.

Note that even after you release your reference and attempt to obtain a new reference, if there is still an active reference, held by another add-in or Outlook, to one of the above objects, your new reference will still point to an out-of-date copy of the object. Therefore, it is important that you release your references as soon as you are finished with the recurring appointment.

The following code example in VBA shows how to release and refresh references in order to obtain up-to-date data for a recurring appointment. The example obtains a set of appointment items from the Calendar folder. It assumes that the first item in the appointment collection is part of a recurring appointment. The example shows that a reference to the appointment collection obtained before an exception is created does not reflect the exception. The example then releases this reference and other existing appointment references, after which new references that point to the appointment collection reflect the exception.

 Set oItemNew = oItems.Item(1) 
 
 
 
 ' If no other add-ins have the same recurring appointment open, 
 
 ' the new references reflect the current exception count. 
 
 Set oEx2 = oItemNew.GetRecurrencePattern().Exceptions 
 
 Debug.Print " New item exceptions: " &amp; oEx2.Count 
 
 
 
 Debug.Print "RE-GET ORIGINAL" 
 
 Set oItemOriginal = oItems.Item(1) 
 
 Set oEx = oItemOriginal.GetRecurrencePattern().Exceptions 
 
 Debug.Print " Original item exceptions: " &amp; oEx.Count 
 
End Sub
```


## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example returns a new appointment.


```
Set myItem = Application.CreateItem(olAppointmentItem)
```
