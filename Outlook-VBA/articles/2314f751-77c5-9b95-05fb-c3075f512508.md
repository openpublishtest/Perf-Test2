## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example creates a  **CalendarSharing** object for the Calendar folder, then exports the contents of the entire folder (including attachments and private items) to an iCalendar calendar (.ics) file.


```vb
Public Sub ExportEntireCalendar() 
 
 
 
 Dim oNamespace As NameSpace 
 
 Dim oFolder As Folder 
 
 Dim oCalendarSharing As CalendarSharing 
 
 
 
 On Error GoTo ErrRoutine 
 
 
 
 ' Get a reference to the Calendar default folder 
 
 Set oNamespace = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set oFolder = oNamespace.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderCalendar) 
 
 
 
 ' Get a CalendarSharing object for the Calendar default folder. 
 
 Set oCalendarSharing = oFolder.GetCalendarExporter 
 
 
 
 ' Set the CalendarSharing object to export the contents of 
 
 ' the entire Calendar folder, including attachments and 
 
 ' private items, in full detail. 
 
 With oCalendarSharing 
 
 .CalendarDetail = olFullDetails 
 
 .IncludeWholeCalendar = True 
 
 .IncludeAttachments = True 
 
 .IncludePrivateDetails = True 
 
 .RestrictToWorkingHours = False 
 
 End With 
 
 
 
 ' Export calendar to an iCalendar calendar (.ics) file.

Exit Sub
