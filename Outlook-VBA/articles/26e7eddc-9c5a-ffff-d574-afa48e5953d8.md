## Remarks

Outlook must be running in order for this event to fire. This event will fire when any of the following occur:


- A store is added through the  **Open Outlook Data File** dialog box, by selecting **Open** and then **Outlook Data File** on the **File** menu.
    
- A store is added through the  **Data Files** tab of the **Account Manager** dialog box.
    
- A store is added successfully by calling the  **[Namespace.AddStore](c9390982-2408-fda5-a14d-de6f0daaadf1.md)** method.
    


This event will not fire when any of the following occurs:


- When Outlook starts and opens a primary or delegate store. 
    
- If a store is added through the  **Mail** applet in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel and Outlook is not running.
    
- A delegate store is added through the  **Advanced** tab of the **Microsoft Exchange Server** dialog box.
    


You can use this event to determine whether a store has been added and take appropriate actions on items in that store. Otherwise, you would have to resort to polling the  **[Stores](8915a8e4-9c22-21d5-c492-051d393ce5f7.md)** collection.
