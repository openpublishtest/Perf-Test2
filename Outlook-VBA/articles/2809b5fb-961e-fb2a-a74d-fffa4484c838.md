# Explorer.ClearSelection Method (Outlook)

Cancels any selection in the active explorer.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ClearSelection**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **[Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

After the  **ClearSelection** method is called, the **[Count](ea7a19d2-6261-ce07-97f3-ebe95489a265.md)** property of the **[Selection](0b06a3ce-0445-db8f-e6e8-bb7bd469c50f.md)** object that the **[Explorer.Selection](11002043-9dab-a5ad-b36e-52ddb04c1859.md)** property returns is zero. Then, the **[SelectionChange](ef0d976f-b9f6-2080-7657-e48d1c64ccb1.md)** event fires unless prior to calling of **ClearSelection** , the current view did not contain any items, the current folder was empty, or the **Count** property was already zero.

If the Reading Pane is visible and the current view is a table view, calling  **ClearSelection** renders the Reading Pane blank.

If the current view or current folder does not contain any items, calling  **ClearSelection** does not result in any change to the selection and does not fire the **SelectionChange** event.

 **ClearSelection** returns an error if the item is being edited in the current view.
