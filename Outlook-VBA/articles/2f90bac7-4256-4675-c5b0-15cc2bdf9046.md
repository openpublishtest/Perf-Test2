# Item-Level Events



Item-level events occur when something happens to an item displayed in a form, such as when it's saved or opened or when a user-defined action is started.
Most often, item-level events are handled by Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) code within the form itself.
Some events can be cancelled. That is, your event handler can prevent Microsoft Outlook from performing the default action associated with the event. For example, you can write an event handler for the  **Forward** event to prevent an item from being sent to recipients who are not on a list of approved recipients.
