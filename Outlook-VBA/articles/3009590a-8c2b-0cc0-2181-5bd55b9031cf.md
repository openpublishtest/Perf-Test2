# ToolTips and Control Tips Overview

Both  **ToolTips** and **control tips** are short, descriptive phrases that appear when the user holds the mouse pointer briefly over a control or another part of the user interface. The difference between **ToolTips** and **control tips** is that Microsoft Outlook provides **ToolTips** to developers at design time, and developers provide **control tips** to end users at run time.

You can customize  **ToolTips** for controls and for the **Control Toolbox**.

A  **control tip** is set with the [ControlTipText](11412cc8-7e62-1382-de69-905d5d75d419.md) property. For example, use **ControlTipText** to set the control tip text for the **Page** object.
