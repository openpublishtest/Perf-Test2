# Manage Your Forms in Forms Manager

You can use  **Forms Manager** to view and organize all of your published forms.


 **Note**  Forms that are customized with form regions are registered in the Windows registry instead of published; you cannot view them in  **Forms Manager**. For more information, see  [Form Regions](66e80f83-60db-e3b1-47e9-097f855f6512.md) and [How to: Create a Form Region](695b95a5-c795-cb4a-8d35-ba12b0007b1f.md).


In  **Forms Manager**, you can browse to the folders where your forms are stored and identify them by number, version, and name. You can also move and copy forms, and view the properties of each form.
