# CalendarSharing Object (Outlook)

Represents a set of utilities for sharing calendar information.


## Remarks

You can use the  **[GetCalendarExporter](7c67e208-65dd-8904-4b6f-8ec2df4e530d.md)** method of a **[Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object that represents a calendar folder to create a **CalendarSharing** object. The **GetCalendarExporter** method can only be used on calendar folders. An error occurs if you use the method on **Folder** objects that represent other folder types.

You can use the  **[SaveAsICal](2314f751-77c5-9b95-05fb-c3075f512508.md)** method to save calendar information in an iCalendar (.ics) file for sharing a calendar as a URL, or use the **[ForwardAsICal](b796a573-784b-6725-535e-fd156a3f233c.md)** method to create a **[MailItem](14197346-05d2-0250-fa4c-4a6b07daf25f.md)** for sharing a calendar as a payload.


 **Note**  The  **CalendarSharing** object only supports exporting the iCalendar format.


## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example creates a  **CalendarSharing** object for the Calendar folder, then exports the contents of the entire folder (including attachments and private items) to an iCalendar calendar (.ics) file.


```vb
Public Sub ExportEntireCalendar() 
 
 
 
 Dim oNamespace As NameSpace 
 
 Dim oFolder As Folder 
 
 Dim oCalendarSharing As CalendarSharing 
 
 
 
 On Error GoTo ErrRoutine 
 
 
 
 ' Get a reference to the Calendar default folder 
 
 Set oNamespace = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set oFolder = oNamespace.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderCalendar) 
 
 
 
 ' Get a CalendarSharing object for the Calendar default folder. 
 
 Set oCalendarSharing = oFolder.GetCalendarExporter 
 
 
 
 ' Set the CalendarSharing object to export the contents of 
 
 ' the entire Calendar folder, including attachments and 
 
 ' private items, in full detail. 
 
 With oCalendarSharing 
 
 .CalendarDetail = olFullDetails 
 
 .IncludeAttachments = True 
 
 .IncludePrivateDetails = True 
 
 .IncludeWholeCalendar = True 
 
 End With 
 
 
 
 ' Export calendar to an iCalendar calendar (.ics) file. 
 
 oCalendarSharing.SaveAsICal "C:\SampleCalendar.ics" 
 
 
 
EndRoutine: 
 
 On Error GoTo 0 
 
 Set oCalendarSharing = Nothing 
 
 Set oFolder = Nothing 
 
 Set oNamespace = Nothing 
 
Exit Sub 
 
 
 
ErrRoutine: 
 
 Select Case Err.Number 
 
 Case 287 ' &amp;H0000011F 
 
 ' The user denied access to the Address Book. 
 
 ' This error occurs if the code is run by an

 Case -2147467259 ' &amp;H80004005 
 
 ' Export failed. 
 
 ' This error typically occurs if the CalendarSharing 
 
 ' method cannot export the calendar information because

 Case Else

 Err.Number &amp; " - " &amp; Err.Source 
 
 End Select 
 
 
 
 GoTo EndRoutine 
 
End Sub
```
