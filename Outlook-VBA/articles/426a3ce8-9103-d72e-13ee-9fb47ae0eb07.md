# OlkControl Object (Outlook)

Defines a set of control properties common to some Microsoft Outlook controls.


## Remarks

The members offered by  **OlkControl** can apply to most Outlook controls. **OlkControl** provides a class to which you can conveniently cast an Outlook control without resorting to reflection. Although **OlkControl** does not apply to Microsoft Forms 2.0 controls, similar properties are available to Forms 2.0 controls. For more information, see[KB 180972: Additional Control Properties Available for Programming](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/180972).


## Example

The following code sample uses the  **[OlkControl](426a3ce8-9103-d72e-13ee-9fb47ae0eb07.md)** class to enable automatic resizing of a text box control with respect to any resizing of the form. It uses casting in Visual Basic to allow the text box control to use the properties of **OlkControl** .


```vb
Sub ResizeWithForm() 
 Dim myTextBox As OlkTextBox 
 Dim olkCtrl As OlkControl 
 
 ' Let the text box control use the properties of OlkControl 
 Set olkCtrl = myTextBox 
 
 ' Enable automatic adjustments of the layout with respect to the rest of the form 
 olkCtrl.EnableAutoLayout = True 
 
 ' Allow resizing the text box control horizontally and vertically with the form 
 olkCtrl.HorizontalLayout = olHorizontalLayoutGrow 
 olkCtrl.VerticalLayout = olVerticalLayoutGrow 
End Sub
```
