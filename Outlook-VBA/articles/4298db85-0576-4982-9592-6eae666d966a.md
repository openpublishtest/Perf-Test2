Obtains an  **[IPictureDisp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680762%28VS.85%29.aspx)** object that represents the picture of the Microsoft Exchange user that is displayed in Microsoft Outlook.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **GetPicture**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **[ExchangeUser](6ec117d1-7fdb-aa36-b567-1242f8238df0.md)** object.


### Return Value

An  **IPictureDisp** object that represents the picture of the Exchange user that is displayed in Outlook.


## Remarks

The picture of the Exchange user is stored in Active Directory and displayed in various places in Outlook, including the dialog box for  **Outlook Properties** and Contact Card.

If the picture does not exist for the user,  **GetPicture** returns **Null** ( **Nothing** for Visual Basic).

You can only call  **GetPicture** from code that runs in-process as Outlook. An **StdPicture** object cannot be marshaled across process boundaries. If you attempt to call **GetPicture** from out-of-process code, an exception occurs.
