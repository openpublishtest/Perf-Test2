## Syntax

- Default folders (as listed by the  **[OlDefaultFolders](1a17abd8-09b9-d3e1-2d93-0a4d5580a950.md)** enumeration)
    
- Special folders (as listed by the  **[OlSpecialFolders](31f32a19-9695-3de4-ef3f-fe763a6f878e.md)** enumeration)

You can only call  **GetCustomIcon** from code that runs in-process as Outlook. An **IPictureDisp** object cannot be marshaled across process boundaries. If you attempt to call **GetCustomIcon** from out-of-process code, an exception occurs.
