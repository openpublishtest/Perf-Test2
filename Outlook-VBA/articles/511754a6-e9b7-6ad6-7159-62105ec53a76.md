# Creating a Property

Outlook provides several ways to add custom properties:



|| ** [UserProperties.Add](88b86622-2234-77be-41e7-b76b0b3a75ad.md)**| ** [ItemProperties.Add](317daeba-e34c-8458-2492-c434707fa805.md)**| ** [PropertyAccessor.SetProperty](2a97c11d-3f5f-65fe-23d6-8efa40dca303.md)**| ** [PropertyAccessor.SetProperties](bf7c86da-5146-9567-5b7e-3e5e63ee5587.md)**|
| **Action**|Adds a custom property specified by  _Name_ and _Type_. If a property of the same name and type already exists, it will be overwritten by a new property. The default value for  _AddToFolderFields_ allows adding the property to the item and as a view field to the folder.|Adds a custom property specified by  _Name_ and _Type_ even if a property of the same name and type already exists. The default value for _AddToFolderFields_ allows adding the property to the item and as a view field to the folder.|Adds a custom property specified by  _SchemaName_ if the provider and the parent object supports property creation, the property does not already exist, and a valid schema name is specified for the property.|For each property in  _SchemaNames_,  ** [PropertyAccessor.SetProperties](bf7c86da-5146-9567-5b7e-3e5e63ee5587.md)** adds it as a custom property if the provider and the parent object supports property creation, the property does not already exist, and a valid schema name is specified for the property.|
