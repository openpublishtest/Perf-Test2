# ConversationHeader Object (Outlook)

Represents a Microsoft Outlook conversation header in a Conversation view.


## Remarks

In Outlook, a conversation groups messages that share the same subject and belong to the same thread. A conversation can also include branches, such as when a message gets two or more responses and discussions grow independently from each response. The Conversation view relates all items in the same conversation across folders and stores. A conversation header can be an item or a group header in one of the following forms: 


- An item in a thread that contains only a single item.
    
- A group header for a conversation that contains multiple items.
    
- The first item in a conversation that contains a single thread.
    
- The first item in a split conversation.
