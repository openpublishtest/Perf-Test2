# Explorer.Activate Method (Outlook)

Activates an explorer window by bringing it to the foreground and setting keyboard focus.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Activate**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Explorer** object.


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications example responds to the  **[NewMail](cfc848e8-98b1-163a-c177-53993c20bb14.md)** event by activating the explorer window. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the `Initialize_handlers` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handlers() 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub NewMail() 
 myOlExp.Activate 
End Sub
```
