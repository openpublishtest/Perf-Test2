# Set Tab Order of Controls on a Page

1. In the Forms Designer, right-click a page, but not a control, and then click  **Tab Order**. 
    
2. Select the name of the control that you want to reposition in the tab order. 
    
3. Click  **Move Up** or **Move Down**.
    

 **Note**  You can also set the tab order by changing the  [TabIndex](360ea7af-7433-d1c9-f5bc-a60ddc1e1851.md) property. The tab index of the first control in the tab order is **0**; the tab index of the second control is  **1**, and so on.
