# Label Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Displays descriptive text.


## Remarks

A  **Label** control on a form displays descriptive text such as titles, captions, pictures, or brief instructions. For example, labels for an address book might include a **Label** for a name, street, or city.

The default property for a  **Label** is the **[Caption](6075400e-e4c0-1a1c-dea1-8628d191337b.md)** property.

You can also display a picture on a  **Label**. However, a  **Label** does not let you crop, size, or zoom the picture.
