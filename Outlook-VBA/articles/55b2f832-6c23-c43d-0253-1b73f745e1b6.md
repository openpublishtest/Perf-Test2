# How to: Reference a Custom Property that Has the Same Name as a Built-in Property of the Control

Assume a new control has a  **Top** property that is different from the standard **Top** property in Microsoft Forms. You can use either property, based on the syntax:


- 
```
  control.Top
```


    uses the standard  **Top** property.
    
- 
```
  control.Object.Top
```


    uses the  **Top** property from the added control.
