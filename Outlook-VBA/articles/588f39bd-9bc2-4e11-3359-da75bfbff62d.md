```vb
Private Sub FilterViewToLastWeek() 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 ' Obtain a View object reference to the current view. 
 
 Set objView = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentView 
 
 
 
 ' Set a DASL filter string, using a DASL macro, to show 
 
 ' only those items that were received last week. 
 
 objView.Filter = "%lastweek(""urn:schemas:httpmail:datereceived"")%"
