# Inspector.Close Event (Outlook)

Occurs when the inspector associated with a Microsoft Outlook item is being closed.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Close**( **_Cancel_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Inspector** object.


## Remarks

In Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), if you set the return value of this function to  **False** , the close operation isn't completed and the inspector is left open. This event cannot be canceled.

If you use the  **[Close](de821cf4-72f8-ba62-3d8d-96548db0b4a0.md)** method to fire this event, it can only be canceled if the **Close** method uses the **olPromptForSave** argument.
