## Remarks

This method is similar to the  **[GetAddressEntryFromID](04e9d2c5-231d-35c8-eafa-0e58fbd7a2a1.md)** method of the **[NameSpace](f0dcaa19-07f5-5d42-a3bf-2e42b7885644.md)** object, but has some additional contextual information about which account to use for the look-up. If there are multiple Microsoft Exchange accounts in the current profile, use the **GetAddressEntryFromID** method for the corresponding account.

The  **ID** property for an **AddressEntry** is a permanent, unique string identifier that the transport provider assigns when an **AddressEntry** is created. Outlook maintains a hierarchy of address books for a session, and the address entry that is returned must match the given ID and be in one of the address books.

 **GetAddressEntryFromID** returns an error if no item with the given ID can be found, if no connection is available, or if the user is set to work offline.
