# Frame Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Represents a functional and visual control group.


## Remarks

All option buttons in a  **Frame** are mutually exclusive, so you can use the **Frame** to create an option group. You can also use a **Frame** to group controls with closely related contents.For example, in an application that processes customer orders, you might use a **Frame** to group the name, address, and account number of customers.

You can also use a  **Frame** to create a group of **[ToggleButton](01ce5640-9f19-3c0e-1aa4-96d87074bf8b.md)** controls, but the toggle buttons are not mutually exclusive.

To create a group of mutually exclusive  **[OptionButton](8009dd64-44b5-3b66-e8d4-e3535e014396.md)** controls, you can put the buttons in a **Frame** on your form, or you can use the ** [OptionButton.GroupName](7b3b92d6-e1e0-6171-4d6a-4b0221e1c083.md)** property.
