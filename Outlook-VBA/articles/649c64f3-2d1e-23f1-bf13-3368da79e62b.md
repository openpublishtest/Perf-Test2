# Default Properties Displayed in a Table Object

A  **[Table](0affaafd-93fe-227a-acee-e09a86cadc20.md)** contains rows and columns, where rows represent items in a folder, and columns represent item properties. When you call ** [Folder.GetTable](08d184cb-0c41-01b1-abc5-305476380f8b.md)**, you obtain a  **Table** object that has a small pre-defined set of columns corresponding to properties common to default items for that type of folder. Similarly, when you call ** [Search.GetTable](3aba6b77-73a3-9620-9c18-b2e03c7b63bc.md)**, you obtain a  **Table** that has columns corresponding to properties common to default items for all folder types. The pre-defined sets of properties are explicit built-in properties. The small size of these sets allows the **GetTable** call to perform relatively efficiently.

The following tables list the set of properties returned by  **GetTable** for each type of folder or a search folder. Properties are stored as a 1-based array in a **[Columns](628bf0cf-4ee8-5e5c-09d7-89d7adf256ca.md)** object.
