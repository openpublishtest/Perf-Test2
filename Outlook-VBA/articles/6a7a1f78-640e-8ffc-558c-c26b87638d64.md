# PlaySoundRuleAction Object (Outlook)

Represents an action that plays a .wav file sound.


## Remarks

 **PlaySoundRuleAction** is derived from the **[RuleAction](6451788f-e5ed-239c-a34d-b564b52d8955.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a **[RuleActions](82ba76cd-86a4-3372-cb51-2df1d58c8b71.md)** object which has a **[PlaySound](43a79f2d-9e7b-7053-6901-40e815220ac0.md)** property. The **PlaySound** property always returns a **PlaySoundRuleAction** object. If the rule has an enabled rule action that plays a sound file, then **[PlaySoundRuleAction.Enabled](7a8b222e-a9db-f38f-8f8b-a834ff46c39a.md)** property would be **True** .
