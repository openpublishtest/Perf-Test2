# SyncObject.SyncEnd Event (Outlook)

Occurs immediately after Microsoft Outlook finishes synchronizing a user's folders using the specified  **Send/Receive** group.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **SyncEnd**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **SyncObject** object.


## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example displays a message when synchronization is complete. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the  `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Dim WithEvents mySync As Outlook.SyncObject 
 
Sub Initialize_handler() 
 Set mySync = Application.Session.SyncObjects.Item(1) 
 mySync.Start 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub mySync_SyncEnd() 
 MsgBox "Synchronization is complete." 
End Sub
```
