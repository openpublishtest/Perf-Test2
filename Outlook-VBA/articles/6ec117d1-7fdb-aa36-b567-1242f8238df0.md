# ExchangeUser Object (Outlook)

Provides detailed information about an  **[AddressEntry](d4a0a85e-8bab-bc56-57bc-d70c3c570c8e.md)** that represents a Microsoft Exchange mailbox user.


## Remarks

 **ExchangeUser** is derived from the **AddressEntry** object, and is returned instead of an **AddressEntry** when the caller performs a query interface on the **AddressEntry** object.

This object provides first-class access to properties applicable to Exchange users such as  **[FirstName](6a72812a-31fd-aa6a-be08-f765018208ab.md)** , **[JobTitle](2cfa5301-3164-c472-3f8e-831c1eebc810.md)** , **[LastName](1f9f9675-3e72-da56-d654-a1473f4f71a7.md)** , and **[OfficeLocation](b37d5622-27ba-b2c4-cfd3-6aa1e9e9296b.md)** . You can also access other properties specific to the Exchange user that are not exposed in the object model through the **[PropertyAccessor](2fc91e13-703c-3ec9-9066-ffee7144306c.md)** object. Note that some of the explicit built-in properties are read-write properties. Setting these properties requires the code to be running under an appropriate Exchange administrator account; without sufficient permissions, calling the **[ExchangeUser.Update](a2672fbf-f32a-f120-227c-24ee5c361f35.md)** method will result in a "permission denied" error.


## Example

The following code sample shows how to obtain the business phone number, office location, and job title for all entries in the Exchange Global Address List.


```vb
Sub DemoAE() 
 
 Dim colAL As Outlook.AddressLists 
 
 Dim oAL As Outlook.AddressList 
 
 Dim colAE As Outlook.AddressEntries 
 
 Dim oAE As Outlook.AddressEntry 
 
 Dim oExUser As Outlook.ExchangeUser 
 
 Set colAL = Application.Session.AddressLists 
 
 For Each oAL In colAL 
 
 'Address list is an Exchange Global Address List 
 
 If oAL.AddressListType = olExchangeGlobalAddressList Then 
 
 Set colAE = oAL.AddressEntries 
 
 For Each oAE In colAE 
 
 If oAE.AddressEntryUserType = _ 
 
 olExchangeUserAddressEntry Then 
 
 Set oExUser = oAE.GetExchangeUser 
 
 Debug.Print(oExUser.JobTitle) 
 
 Debug.Print(oExUser.OfficeLocation) 
 
 Debug.Print(oExUser.BusinessTelephoneNumber) 
 
 End If 
 
 Next 
 
 End If 
 
 Next 
 
End Sub
```
