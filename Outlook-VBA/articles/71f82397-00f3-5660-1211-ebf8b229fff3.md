 Dim myItem As Outlook.MailItem 
 
 Dim myattachments As Outlook.Attachments 
 
 
 
 Set myinspector = Application.ActiveInspector 
 
 If Not TypeName(myinspector) = "Nothing" Then 
 
 Set myItem = myinspector.CurrentItem.Forward 
 
 Set myattachments = myItem.Attachments 
 
 While myattachments.Count > 0 
 
 myattachments.Remove 1 
 
 Wend 
 
 myItem.Display 
 
 myItem.Recipients.Add "Dan Wilson" 
 
 myItem.Send 
 
 Else 
 
 MsgBox "There is no active inspector." 
 
 End If 
 
End Sub
