# Difference between a Field and a Column

A column is collection of cells aligned vertically in a table. A field is an element in which one piece of information is stored, such as the  **Received** field. Usually, a column in a table contains the values of a single field. However, you can show several fields in a column by using a **Formula** or a **Combination** field. Fields can also be shown as rows in a card view or as controls on a form. A column is just one way to display the contents of a field.
