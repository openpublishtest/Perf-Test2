## Remarks

 **IsDataFileStore** supports only Exchange stores, and will return **False** for HTTP-type stores such as Hotmail and MSN, and for IMAP stores.

For Exchange stores,  **IsDataFileStore** will return **False** if the user profile is not using Cached Exchange mode. **IsDataFileStore** will also return **False** when the store is an Exchange Public Folder (that is, **[Store.ExchangeStoreType](ca6002bd-444d-a111-adca-6f8fafc37ea1.md)** is **olExchangePublicFolder** ).

 **IsDataFileStore** does not indicate whether the store is located on a local hard drive. For example, a .pst file could be located on a mapped network drive and **IsDataFileStore** would still return **True** .

The return value of  **IsDataFileStore** can change if the user is configured for classic Exchange offline mode. When the user is offline and using classic Exchange offline mode, **IsDataFileStore** will return **True** . When the user is online and using classic Exchange online mode, **IsDataFileStore** will return **False** .
