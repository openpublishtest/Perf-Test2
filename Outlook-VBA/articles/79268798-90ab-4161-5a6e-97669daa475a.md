Returns or sets an  **[OlDaysOfWeek](49712ccf-4ff7-bfdc-c023-94bcd0d97046.md)** constant representing the mask for the days of the week on which the recurring appointment or task occurs. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **DayOfWeekMask**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **RecurrencePattern** object.


## Remarks

The  **DayOfWeekMask** should be set after the **[RecurrenceType](bc9b35b5-ef00-e5cf-09cc-ee8743efddcf.md)** property has been set and before the **[PatternEndDate](0f78ea71-3d92-2d38-be10-e05ab7bcf44a.md)** and **[PatternStartDate](20c82dbd-a622-91b6-618c-7cbe8bff2ca7.md)** properties are set.

Monthly and yearly patterns are only valid for a single day. Weekly patterns are only valid as the  **Or** of the **DayOfWeekMask** .


## Example

This Visual Basic for Applications example uses  **[GetRecurrencePattern](a9f67c5b-a77f-4e34-e654-d12560a6dba0.md)** to obtain the **[RecurrencePattern](36c098f7-59fb-879a-5173-ed0260d13fa4.md)** object for the newly-created **[AppointmentItem](204a409d-654e-27aa-643a-8344c631b82d.md)** . The properties, **[RecurrenceType](bc9b35b5-ef00-e5cf-09cc-ee8743efddcf.md)** , **DayOfWeekMask** , **PatternStartDate** , **PatternEndDate** , **[Duration](91cceed3-fd56-bae3-ee00-16f4b02eb2e3.md)** , **[StartTime](557e0f8d-c95d-e1f9-91a2-0734248d8628.md)** , **[EndTime](7babda13-9e57-4c80-1ab3-56025753ed9d.md)** , and **[Subject](57f0f242-6d04-175f-4ea2-25145787f5bd.md)** are set, the appointment is saved and then displayed with the pattern: "Occurs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday effective 7/10/2006 until 8/25/2006 from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM."


```vb
Sub RecurringAppointmentEveryMondayWednesdayFriday() 
 
 Dim oAppt As AppointmentItem 
 
 Dim oPattern As RecurrencePattern 
 
 Set oAppt = Application.CreateItem(olAppointmentItem) 
 
 Set oPattern = oAppt.GetRecurrencePattern 
 
 With oPattern 
 
 .RecurrenceType = olRecursWeekly 
 
 .DayOfWeekMask = olMonday Or olWednesday Or olFriday 
 
 .PatternStartDate = #7/10/2006# 
 
 .PatternEndDate = #8/25/2006# 
 
 .Duration = 60 
 
 .StartTime = #2:00:00 PM# 
 
 .EndTime = #3:00:00 PM# 
 
 End With 
 
 oAppt.Subject = "Recurring Appointment Monday Wednesday Friday" 
 
 oAppt.Save 
 
 oAppt.Display 
 
End Sub
```

Similar to the last example, this Visual Basic for Applications example also uses  **GetRecurrencePattern** to obtain the **RecurrencePattern** object for the newly-created **AppointmentItem** . The properties, **RecurrenceType** , **DayOfWeekMask** , **PatternStartDate** , **PatternEndDate** , **Duration** , **StartTime** , **EndTime** , and **Subject** are set, the appointment is saved and then displayed with the pattern: "Occurs every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday effective 7/10/2006 until 8/4/2006."




```vb
Sub RecurringEventEveryWeekday() 
 
 Dim oPattern As Outlook.RecurrencePattern 
 
 Dim oAppt As Outlook.AppointmentItem 
 
 Set oAppt = Application.CreateItem(olAppointmentItem) 
 
 Set oPattern = oAppt.GetRecurrencePattern 
 
 With oPattern 
 
 .RecurrenceType = olRecursWeekly 
 
 .DayOfWeekMask = olMonday Or olTuesday Or olWednesday Or olThursday Or olFriday 
 
 .PatternStartDate = #7/10/2006# 
 
 .PatternEndDate = #8/4/2006# 
 
 .Duration = 1440 'Duration in minutes, for all day event = 24 * 60 
 
 .StartTime = #12:00:00 AM# 
 
 .EndTime = #12:00:00 AM# 
 
 End With 
 
 oAppt.Subject = "Recurring Event Every Weekday" 
 
 oAppt.Save 
 
 oAppt.Display 
 
End Sub 
 

```
