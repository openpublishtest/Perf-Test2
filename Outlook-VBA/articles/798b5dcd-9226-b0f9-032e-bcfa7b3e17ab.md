# TimelineView.Standard Property (Outlook)

Returns a  **Boolean** value that indicates whether the **[TimelineView](fb14c1a1-f542-fa1e-f30f-c5ee3d2f0206.md)** object is a built-in Outlook view. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Standard**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TimelineView** object.


## Remarks

The  **[Reset](fb909688-309d-0a70-0b67-0f1793f6a27d.md)** method can only be used on a view if the value of this property is set to **True** .


## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example enumerates through the  **[Views](5dd7edc2-12a2-f4c2-d158-8053d80e8dc9.md)** collection of the current **[Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object, using the **Standard** property to determine if a **View** object is a built-in Outlook view. If the **View** object is a built-in Outlook view, the sample calls the **Reset** method to reset the view to its default settings. Otherwise, the sample uses the **[Delete](6d332021-6e93-7665-2a5b-526c927621de.md)** method to delete the view.


```vb
Private Sub RemoveAllViewCustomization() 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 ' Enumerate each View object in the Views collection 
 
 ' of the current Folder object. 
 
 For Each objView In Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentFolder.Views 
 
 ' If the View object is a built-in Outlook view, reset 
 
 ' the view to its default settings. If the View object 
 
 ' is a custom view, delete it. 
 
 If objView.Standard Then 
 
 objView.Reset 
 
 Else 
 
 objView.Delete 
 
 End If 
 
 Next 
 
End Sub 
 

```
