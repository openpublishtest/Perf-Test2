# Label.Caption Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **String** that appears on an object to identify or describe it. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Caption**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Label** object.


## Remarks

The default caption for a control is a unique name based on the type of control. For example, CommandButton1 is the default caption for the first command button in a form.

If a control's caption is too long, the caption is truncated. If a form's caption is too long for the title bar, the title is displayed with an ellipsis.

The  **[ForeColor](1454c43d-d4a7-20d9-2c88-2b1315d0efbb.md)** property of the control determines the color of the text in the caption.

Setting  **[AutoSize](22634bb4-2434-d31a-cb2d-2bcd4e513677.md)** to **True** automatically adjusts the size of the control to frame the entire caption.
