# RemoteItem.AfterWrite Event (Outlook)

Occurs after Microsoft Outlook has saved the item.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AfterWrite**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **RemoteItem** object.


## Remarks

The  **AfterWrite** event occurs after the **[Write](a38eef6b-23da-ba10-ad94-cc63e2bf60c2.md)** event. This event is not cancelable. To determine when the item is unloaded from memory, use the **[Unload](8d105e1a-4923-4296-10b1-6e26fed51539.md)** event.

The  **AfterWrite** event corresponds to the Exchange Client Extensions (ECE) event **IExchExtMessageEvents::OnWriteComplete** .

Only the following members of the item object can be accessed in the  **AfterWrite** event:


-  **[Class](031c46f0-2cca-3891-080f-5bbb286d1a6c.md)**
    
-  **[MessageClass](cdb17ebc-ea8a-31b1-ef32-e9e4dda872c7.md)**
    
-  **MAPIOBJECT**
    
The  **MAPIOBJECT** property is a hidden property in the Outlook object model. This property provides access to the underlying MAPI **[IMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc842097%28office.14%29.aspx)** object, and can be invoked only via the **[IUnknown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680509%28VS.85%29.aspx)** interface. The property is accessible to programs written in languages such as C or C++ that support **IUnknown** . **MAPIOBJECT** is not available through the **[IDispatch](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221608.aspx)** interface. Development languages such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Visual C#, and Visual Basic support the **IDispatch** interface and not **IUnknown** , and therefore, they cannot access **MAPIOBJECT** . If other properties or methods of the parent item are accessed in this event, Outlook raises an error.

The object obtained from the  **MAPIOBJECT** property in this event must contain all the changes persisted by Outlook. The implementer can call the **[SaveChanges](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc842181%28office.14%29.aspx)** method on the **IMessage** object to persist changes to the underlying **IMessage** object represented by **MAPIOBJECT** , and Outlook will not revert those changes.

Implementers must release the object obtained from the  **MAPIOBJECT** property in the event before the event completes. Attempting to use that object outside the context of the event is unsupported and will lead to unpredictable behavior.
