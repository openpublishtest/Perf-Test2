# SpinButton.Delay Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **Long** that specifies the delay in milliseconds, between events on a **[SpinButton](3221b356-1e68-9e14-48ab-4a30c38aa685.md)**. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Delay**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **SpinButton** object.


## Remarks

The  **Delay** property affects the amount of time between consecutive **SpinUp**,  **SpinDown**, and  **Change** events generated when the user clicks and holds down a button on a **SpinButton**. The first event occurs immediately. The delay to the second occurrence of the event is five times the value of the specified  **Delay**. This initial lag makes it easy to generate a single event rather than a stream of events.

After the initial lag, the interval between events is the value specified for  **Delay**.

The default value of  **Delay** is 50 milliseconds. This means the object initiates the first event after 250 milliseconds (5 times the specified value) and initiates each subsequent event after 50 milliseconds.
