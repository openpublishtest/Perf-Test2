# Explorer.Activate Event (Outlook)

Occurs when an explorer becomes the active window, either as a result of user action or through program code.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Activate**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Explorer** object.


## Remarks

This event is not available in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).


## Example

This code example uses the  **[WindowState](787b6339-eb92-3ab6-df9f-82f6122facc5.md)** property to maximize the topmost explorer window when the **Activate** event occurs. The sample code must be placed in a class module, and the `Initialize_handler` routine must be called before the event procedure can be called by Microsoft Outlook.


```vb
Public WithEvents myOlExp As Outlook.Explorer 
 
 
 
Public Sub Initialize_handler() 
 
 Set myOlExp = Application.ActiveExplorer 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Private Sub myOlExp_Activate() 
 
 If myOlExp.WindowState = olNormalWindow Then _ 
 
 myOlExp.WindowState = olMaximized 
 
End Sub
```
