# OlkTextBox.SelLength Property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a  **Long** that specifies the number of characters in the current selection. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **SelLength**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **OlkTextBox** object.


## Remarks

The current selection is specified by  **[SelText](ba529e92-8a28-1c50-bf0a-0e67ae3645bc.md)** , which is a portion of the control's **[Value](6c0efe12-7b85-344e-a14c-3e628b0a3877.md)** . The maximum number of characters that can be supported for **Value** is **[MaxLength](7e7621e9-817a-ac05-a4de-e86656a021b1.md)** .

The default value is zero, which means no text is currently selected.

The  **SelLength** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus.

Setting  **SelLength** to a value less than zero causes an error. Attempting to set the value greater than **MaxLength** results in setting **SelLength** to **MaxLength** .
