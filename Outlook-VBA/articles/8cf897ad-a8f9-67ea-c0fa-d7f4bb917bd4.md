# AddressRuleCondition Object (Outlook)

Represents a rule condition that evaluates whether the address for the recipient or sender of the message is contained in the address specified in  **[AddressRuleCondition.Address](de4186ec-0741-8ff6-7789-af0a46c470e0.md)** .


## Remarks

 **AddressRuleCondition** is derived from the **[RuleCondition](e03f91c2-2c08-b036-104a-d6246f28bc2d.md)** object. Each rule is associated with a **[RuleConditions](e8e9a05a-b36b-add2-b294-8cdc5a97e119.md)** object which has a **[RecipientAddress](1b8f361e-0481-75dc-e66e-2bc69228773a.md)** property and a **[SenderAddress](6e5eb1cc-385f-b1b2-aea7-12629cc31030.md)** . Each of these properties always returns a **AddressRuleCondition** object. **[AddressRuleCondition.ConditionType](8b531745-1a4d-d903-5c7d-465b9fd8cbf3.md)** distinguishes among these rule conditions. If the rule has any of these rule conditions enabled, then **[AddressRuleCondition.Enabled](170cd84c-4733-0801-c411-34736e2e1a06.md)** would be **True** .
