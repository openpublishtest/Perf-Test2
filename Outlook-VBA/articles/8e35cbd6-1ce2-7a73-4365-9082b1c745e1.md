# Automatically Insert Prefix Text into the Subject Field of a Reply Form

## Customizing with form regions

In a form region, you can set the subject prefix in the XML manifest file of the form region. Alternatively, you can write code in the  [BeforeFormRegionShow](c93c2f6a-511f-15cd-eca2-4eb35af9939a.md) method of the [FormRegionStartup](948ea6b7-2962-57e7-618d-fa0977b65651.md) interface.

## Customizing with form pages


1. In the Forms Designer, click the  **(Actions)** page of your form.
    
2. Click the action to which you want to add the prefix text, and then click  **Properties**. 
    
3. In the  **Subject prefix** box, type the text as you want it to appear (Outlook automatically adds a colon after the text).
    
    For example, you could add the prefix "Re:" to a reply form.
