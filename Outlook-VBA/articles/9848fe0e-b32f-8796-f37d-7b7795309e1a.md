# SharingItem.Delete Method (Outlook)

Removes a  **[SharingItem](63dd3451-44f3-7cc4-c6e2-7dad5835a7d2.md)** item from the folder that contains the item.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Delete**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **SharingItem** object.


## Remarks

The  **Delete** method deletes a single item in a collection. To delete all items in the **[Items](441820e7-5fe8-e5ef-83c0-9c87fd3dc9e3.md)** collection of a folder, you must delete each item starting with the last item in the folder. For example, in the items collection of a folder, `AllItems`, if there are  `n` number of items in the folder, start deleting the item at `AllItems.Item(n)`, decrementing the index each time until you delete  `AllItems.Item(1)`.

The  **Delete** method moves the item from the containing folder to the **Deleted Items** folder. If the containing folder is the **Deleted Items** folder, the **Delete** method removes the item permanently.
