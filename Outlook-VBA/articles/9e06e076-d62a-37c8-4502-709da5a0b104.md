# Using Multiple Accounts for the Same Profile on Outlook

You can log on to Microsoft Outlook by using a profile that specifies one or more accounts associated with different delivery stores. For a given session, the  **NameSpace** object has members that maintain and access information for the primary Exchange account, and the [Accounts](80e969ea-d2cc-966d-5fe4-68d59951b5c9.md) property of the [NameSpace](f0dcaa19-07f5-5d42-a3bf-2e42b7885644.md) object holds information for all the accounts defined for the session's profile. The **NameSpace.Accounts** property returns an [Accounts](2510b7d7-5062-8ea3-dda4-b544d2882a2b.md) collection for the current profile, tracking information for all accounts including Exchange, IMAP, and POP3 accounts, each of which can be associated with a different delivery store. To identify the primary Exchange account in the **Accounts** collection for a session, look for the account that has the [ExchangeStoreType](ca6002bd-444d-a111-adca-6f8fafc37ea1.md) property of the store (that is specified by ** [Account.DeliveryStore](181d52ff-7c48-af7b-dbec-3562f1c8801b.md)**) equal to  **OlExchangeStoreType.olPrimaryExchangeMailbox**. In other words:


```
Account.DeliveryStore.ExchangeStoreType = OlExchangeStoreType.olPrimaryExchangeMailbox
```


The following table compares members of the  **NameSpace** object and members of the [Account](f624438c-4e45-2822-18b6-bfe8074a33c0.md),  **Accounts**, or  [Store](1eb22fe9-8849-7476-5388-2515b48591b9.md) object depending on whether there is one account or multiple accounts in the session's profile.
