# Using the Script Editor

The Microsoft Script Editor allows you to add Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) procedures that respond to events generated by items or form controls.

 **To run in developer mode**

If you can see the  **Developer** tab, you are running in developer mode. Otherwise, see [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](8f81b1ce-333d-d9be-2af7-cfc65bf15e22.md) to run in developer mode.

 **To open the Script Editor**

1. Open an item of the type to which you want to add code.
    
2. On the  **Developer** tab, in the **Form** group, click **Design This Form**.
    
3. In the  **Form** group, click **View Code**.
    
The Script Editor makes it easy to insert the template for an item event handler.
 **To insert a blank item event handler**

1. On the  **Script** menu, click **Event Handler**.
    
2. Select the event you want to respond to, and then click  **Add**.
    
The Script Editor can move the insertion point to a specific line of code. This makes it easy to debug the script when Microsoft Outlook reports an error at a specific location.
 **To move to a specific line**

1. On the  **Edit** menu, click **Go To**.
    
2. In the  **Line Number** box, type in the number of the line of code to which you want to go. Click **OK**.
