# TabStop Property (Outlook Controls)

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that indicates whether an object can receive focus when the user tabs to it. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **TabStop**

 _expression_A variable that represents an Outlook control object.


## Remarks

 **True** to designate the object as a tab stop (default), **False** to bypass the object when the user is tabbing, although the object still holds its place in the actual tab order, as determined by the **[TabIndex](cef32d27-35a6-28b5-657f-0ea1bcb8e10d.md)** property.

You can combine the settings of the  **Enabled** and the **TabStop** properties to prevent the user from selecting a command button with TAB, while still allowing the user to click the button. Setting **TabStop** to **False** means that the command button won't appear in the tab order.
