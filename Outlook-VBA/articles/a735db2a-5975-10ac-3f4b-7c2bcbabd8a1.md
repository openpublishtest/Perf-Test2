# Designing Outlook Workgroup Solutions

With Microsoft Outlook, you can create a variety of workgroup solutions and forms. You can create simple forms with no programming involved or create advanced forms by using custom controls, properties, and Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript). You can also use form regions, including Separate form regions, which are individual pages that you can add to a standard Outlook form, or that you can use to create a new custom form that is based on a standard Outlook form. For more information, see  [Form Regions](66e80f83-60db-e3b1-47e9-097f855f6512.md).

There are a few basic approaches to creating Outlook solutions. One method is to modify an existing item, such as a contact entry or an e-mail message, by adding additional pages and fields. With this method, you can extend the use of the item by adding the fields and pages that you need without writing any code. To create advanced forms, you can use the  [Control Toolbox](0dac9ed6-d9d5-1c3b-cfd2-ce564e5dc6e2.md) and VBScript to access properties, events, methods, and objects within Outlook.
