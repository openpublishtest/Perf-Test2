# OlkOptionButton Object (Outlook)

A control that supports a single exclusive selection within a defined group of option button choices.


## Remarks

Before you use this control for the first time in the forms designer, add the Microsoft Outlook Option Button Control to the control toolbox. You can only add this control to a form region in an Outlook form using the forms designer.

The following is an example of an option button control at runtime. This control supports Microsoft Windows themes.

Typically more than one option button control is defined in a group. Each option button control in the group provides a single, mutually exclusive choice. Selecting one option button in the group will automatically remove the prior selection of another option button in the same group.
