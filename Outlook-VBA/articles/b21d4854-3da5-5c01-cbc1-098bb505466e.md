## Remarks

Outlook must be running in order for this event to fire. This event will fire when any of the following occurs:


- A store is removed by the user clicking the  **Close** command on the Shortcut menu.
    
- A store is removed programmatically by calling  **[Namespace.RemoveStore](4353387a-0e44-1d4a-b0e6-96e2c2594a6d.md)** .
    


This event will not fire when any of the following occurs:


- When Outlook shuts down and closes a primary or delegate store.
    
- If a store is removed through the  **Mail** applet in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel and Outlook is not running.
    
- A delegate store is removed on the  **Advanced** tab of the **Microsoft Exchange Server** dialog box.
    
- A store is removed through the  **Data Files** tab of the **Account Manager** dialog box when Outlook is not running.
    
- An IMAP Store is removed from the profile.
    


You can use this event to determine that a store has been removed, and take appropriate actions if the store is required for your application (such as remounting the store). Otherwise you would have to resort to polling the  **[Stores](8915a8e4-9c22-21d5-c492-051d393ce5f7.md)** collection.
