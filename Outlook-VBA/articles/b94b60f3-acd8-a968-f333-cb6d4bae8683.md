If the user chooses to view only custom views, the **CustomViewsOnly** property is set to **True** . Once the property is changed, the outcome of the change can be seen in the user interface.


```vb
Sub SetCusView() 
 
 'Sets the CustomViewsOnly property depending on the user's response 
 
 Dim nmsName As Outlook.NameSpace 
 
 Dim fldFolder As Outlook.Folder 
 
 Dim lngAns As Long 
 
 
 
 Set nmsName = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI") 
 
 Set fldFolder = nmsName.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox) 
 
 'Prompt user for input 
 
 lngAns = MsgBox( _ 
 
 "Would you like to view only custom views in the View menu?", vbYesNo) 
 
 Call SetVal(fldFolder, lngAns) 
 
End Sub 
 
 
 
Sub SetVal(ByRef fldFolder As Folder, ByVal lngAns As Long) 
 
 'Modifies the CustomViewsOnly property to display views on the View menu 
 
 If lngAns = vbYes Then 
 
 fldFolder.CustomViewsOnly = True 
 
 Else 
 
 fldFolder.CustomViewsOnly = False 
 
 End If 
 
 'Display only custom views 
 
 If lngAns = vbYes Then 
 
 MsgBox "The View menu for the " _
