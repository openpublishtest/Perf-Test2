# RemoteItem.BeforeAttachmentSave Event (Outlook)

Occurs just before an attachment is saved.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **BeforeAttachmentSave**( **_Attachment_** , **_Cancel_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[RemoteItem](6302aaff-cdcf-4d86-60f1-4bed15540d9f.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Attachment_|Required| **[Attachment](3e11582b-ac90-0948-bc37-506570bb287b.md)**|The attachment to be saved.|
| _Cancel_|Required| **Boolean**|(Not used in VBScript).  **False** when the event occurs. If the event procedure sets this argument to **True** , the save operation is not completed and the attachment is not changed.|

## Remarks

This event corresponds to when attachments are saved to the messaging store. The  **BeforeAttachmentSave** event occurs just before an attachment is saved when an item is saved. If a user edits an attachment and then saves those changes, the **BeforeAttachmentSave** event will not occur at that time; instead it will occur when the item itself is later saved. It also does not occur when the attachment is saved on the hard disk using the **[SaveAsFile](d755261a-d551-f3a1-1b20-d87d4d9c38ae.md)** method.

In VBScript, if you set the return value of this function to  **False** , the save operation is cancelled and the attachment is not changed.
