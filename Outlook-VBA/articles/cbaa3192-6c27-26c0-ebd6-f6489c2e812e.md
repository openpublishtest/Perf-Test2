# Outlook Views

Microsoft Outlook allows you to create customizable views that allow you to better sort, group, and ultimately view data of all different types within an explorer. There are a variety of different view types that provide the flexibility needed to create and maintain your important data. Outlook supports the following objects, derived from the  **[View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)** object.



|Object name|Description|
| **[BusinessCardView](83706cf8-080c-fbf0-9381-5801a2dd4dfd.md)**|This object allows you to view data as a series of Electronic Business Card (EBC) images.|
| **[CalendarView](37e078b9-9fc6-5894-b043-06d7257666a8.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a calendar format.|
| **[CardView](cdac229b-f2b6-9ecb-e1a7-b53509426570.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a series of cards.|
| **[IconView](dc2efa6c-4752-f713-f77e-378036f358dc.md)**|This object allows you to view data as icons, similar to a Windows folder or explorer.|
| **[TableView](026e27f8-1655-060d-e8cc-87eaaf4f1510.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a simple, field-based table.|
| **[TimelineView](fb14c1a1-f542-fa1e-f30f-c5ee3d2f0206.md)**|This object allows you to view data in a customizable linear time line.|

While you can use the  **View** object to interact with the properties and methods common to all views, you must cast the **View** object to one of the derived view objects, such as the **CardView** object, to access certain properties, such as the **[HeadingsFont](3287437e-4ac5-35f5-818a-caea608f8095.md)** property of the **CardView** object. You can use the **[ViewType](db44b9ec-cb55-c9f4-d621-32d2f46598dd.md)** property of the **View** object to determine which type of view is represented by that object.

You can define a new view by using the  **[Add](8005ca2e-8b28-1286-74d1-448f2a168c65.md)** method of the **[Views](5dd7edc2-12a2-f4c2-d158-8053d80e8dc9.md)** collection for a **[Folder](3cf6cda8-6d70-666e-2643-9d9c5b9cacfc.md)** object. Visibility for the view can be set either at the time of creation, by specifying an **[OlViewSaveOption](c08bab4d-ecdd-a2ac-1cdc-fa910f9585e0.md)** constant in the _SaveOption_ parameter of the **Add** method, or any time after the view is created, by specifying an **OlViewSaveOption** constant for the **[SaveOption](d7990708-5eb4-1b11-944e-127793bdb5b1.md)** property of the **View** object. Adding a new view raises the **[ViewAdd](926eb4eb-7585-5bb0-b214-6e116a01375e.md)** event of the **Views** collection.
You can use the  **[Remove](73a92be6-8dc4-6fb9-7f20-0ff678445737.md)** method of the **Views** object to remove an existing custom view. Removing a view raises the **[ViewRemove](a0d405fd-aa57-c333-8e33-aa482019d9c8.md)** event of the **Views** collection.
Once a view is defined, you can customize the view programmatically by casting the  **View** object to one of the derived view objects, such as the **BusinessCardView** object, and performing whatever changes are needed. Use the **[Save](effc4046-2e9c-3898-e37f-c4de817ddde7.md)** method of the derived view object or the **View** object to save any changes to the view.
You can apply the view, once defined and customized, to the current  **[Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)** object by using the **[Apply](b121d1ce-24b7-4ace-8369-42e5c7becd0a.md)** method of the derived view object or the **View** object. Applying a view raises the **[ViewSwitch](ab981f42-d429-ccd7-a25c-142e52683020.md)** event of the **Explorer** object.
