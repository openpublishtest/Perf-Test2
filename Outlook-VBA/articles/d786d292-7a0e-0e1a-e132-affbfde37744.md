# Enumerating, Searching, and Filtering Items in a Folder

The Outlook object model provides several entry points that support enumerating, searching, and filtering items in a folder. 


## Enumerating Items

The  **[Items](3a99730b-e62a-5ca6-f6ec-911c95173242.md)**,  **[Table](0affaafd-93fe-227a-acee-e09a86cadc20.md)**, and  **[Selection](0b06a3ce-0445-db8f-e6e8-bb7bd469c50f.md)** objects all support enumerating items in a folder. However, there are specific scenarios where you would choose one over the others.

You can obtain an  **Items** collection by calling ** [Folder.Items](441820e7-5fe8-e5ef-83c0-9c87fd3dc9e3.md)** which returns the items in the folder. Each item object in the collection is complete with all its explicit built-in properties and custom properties, and supports read-write operations. The **Items** collection also supports filters and events that fire when items are added, changed, or removed from the collection.

You can use  ** [Folder.GetTable](08d184cb-0c41-01b1-abc5-305476380f8b.md)** or ** [Search.GetTable](3aba6b77-73a3-9620-9c18-b2e03c7b63bc.md)** to obtain a **Table** object that represents a set of items in a folder or search folder. In both cases, you can specify a filter to obtain a subset of the items in the folder, or, if you do not specify any filter, obtain all the items in the folder. By default, each item in the returned **Table** contains only a default subset of its properties. You can view each row of a **Table** as an item in the folder, each column as a property of the item, and the **Table** is an in-memory light-weight rowset that allows fast enumeration and filtering of items in the folder. Although additions and deletions of the underlying folder are reflected by the rows in the **Table**, the  **Table** does not support any events for adding, changing, and removing rows. If you require a writeable object from the **Table** row, obtain the Entry ID for that row from the default EntryID column in the **Table** and then use the **[GetItemFromID](f2abff80-4c04-998b-654b-28600424a16f.md)** method of the **[NameSpace](f0dcaa19-07f5-5d42-a3bf-2e42b7885644.md)** object to obtain a full item, such as a **[MailItem](14197346-05d2-0250-fa4c-4a6b07daf25f.md)** or **[ContactItem](8e32093c-a678-f1fd-3f35-c2d8994d166f.md)**, that supports read-write operations. For more information on default columns in a  **Table**, see  [Default Properties Displayed in a Table Object](649c64f3-2d1e-23f1-bf13-3368da79e62b.md).

The  **Selection** object supports enumerating items that a user has currently selected in an explorer. Since the explorer displays the contents of a folder, the **Selection** object supports enumeration of items in that folder as per the user's selection.


 **Note**  A folder in Outlook can contain heterogeneous items. For example, the Contacts folder supports creating contact items and distribution list items by default. Since the  **Items**,  **Table**, and  **Selection** objects encapsulate items in a folder or search folder, the items in them do not necessarily have the same message class. When enumerating items in these collections and objects, it is a good practice to first check for the message class of each item before accessing the item's properties.


## Searching and Filtering Items

The  **Items**,  **Table**,  **[Application](797003e7-ecd1-eccb-eaaf-32d6ddde8348.md)**, and  **[View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)** objects support searching and filtering of items in a folder. The following table describes and compares these entry points:





| **Entry Point**| **Action**| **Object of Search Filter**| ** Jet Filter Support**| **DASL Filter Support**| **Comments**|
| ** [Application.AdvancedSearch](7b433d8b-08b9-dff1-b854-287d76b47a90.md)**|Sets the criteria for a  **Search** object and returns the **Search** object. ** [Search.Results](405166fa-d0bc-33d2-f4aa-908fb821edd6.md)** specifies the search results. ** [Search.Save](a6dbec81-67fd-e337-b640-4f94ab36218f.md)** updates a search folder with the search results.|Folder|No|Yes||
| **Folder.GetTable**|Returns a  **Table** of items in a folder based on any given filter.|Folder|Yes|Yes|Certain properties are not supported in the  **Table** filter, including binary properties, and HTML or RTF body content. For more information, see [Unsupported Properties in a Table Object or Table Filter](0e37f03f-7677-ca29-d0b2-8b45c026e5f1.md).|
| ** [Items.Find](e7a791d8-b80b-df07-84a3-a85acabfcf80.md)**|Searches for first item that satisfies the specified filter. |Folder|Yes|No|Certain properties are not supported in the filter, including  **Body**. For more information, see  **Items.Find**.|
| ** [Items.Restrict](e3b0cda1-e43d-cc5e-2942-0f54935d9dab.md)**|Filters given set of items based on specified restrictions and returns another  **Items** collection.|Folder|Yes|Yes|Certain properties are not supported in the filter, for example,  **Body**. For more information, see  **Items.Restrict**.|
| **Search.GetTable**|Returns a  **Table** of items in a search folder based on any filter derived from **Application.AdvancedSearch**.|Search folder|No|Yes| **Search.GetTable** derives its filter from the **Search** object (specifically the ** [Search.Filter](f6040465-da73-56f6-edb7-06d93bb8b531.md)** property) returned from **Application.AdvancedSearch**.|
| ** [Table.Restrict](ecdd30f6-e12c-8025-3ded-592d2fad2bb8.md)**|Filters rows in the given table based on a specified filter and returns another  **Table** object.|Folder|Yes|Yes|Certain properties are not supported in the  **Table** filter, including binary properties, and HTML or RTF body content. For more information, see [Unsupported Properties in a Table Object or Table Filter](0e37f03f-7677-ca29-d0b2-8b45c026e5f1.md).|
| ** [View.Filter](9a4b4b27-d543-df82-3058-e0a6ad2f51a1.md)**|Sets a view's filter without changing the view's XML. Setting the filter for a view only changes the view in the user interface and does not result in a filtered  **Items** collecton.|Folder|No|Yes||
| ** [View.XML](a933daaa-370f-2ed3-0a59-86f766a1f2c8.md)**|Gets or sets the XML for a view. Modifying the <Filter> node changes the view's filter. Setting the XML for a view only changes the view in the user interface and does not result in a filtered  **Items** collecton.|Folder|No|Yes|View XML is being deprecated. Use the View object model to program views.|
