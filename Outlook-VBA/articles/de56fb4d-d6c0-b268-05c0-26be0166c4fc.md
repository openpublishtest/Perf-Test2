# Save a Form in a Forms Library

 **Note**  This Help topic describes how to save a form that you customized with form pages; it does not apply to forms that you customized with form regions. With form regions, you save the layout of the form region by clicking  **Form Region**, and then  **Save Form Region** to save the form region layout file with an .ofs extension. After that, you must create a form region manifest XML file and register the form region in the Windows registry. For more information, see [How to: Create a Form Region](695b95a5-c795-cb4a-8d35-ba12b0007b1f.md).
