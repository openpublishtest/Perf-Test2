# Set the Background Color of a Form

1. Open the form that you want to modify in design mode. 
    
     **Note**  For more information, see  [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](8f81b1ce-333d-d9be-2af7-cfc65bf15e22.md).
2. On the  **Developer** tab, in the **Tools** group, click **Advanced Properties**. 
    
3. Click the  **BackColor** property, and then type a value in the **Properties** box.
    
4. Click  **Apply**. 
    

 **Note**  When you use form regions, if the form background value is set to  **Button Face** (the default), the background color is automatically determined based on the current Microsoft Office theme. Setting the color to another value prevents the color from being automatically determined. For more information, see [Creating a Form Region](695b95a5-c795-cb4a-8d35-ba12b0007b1f.md).
