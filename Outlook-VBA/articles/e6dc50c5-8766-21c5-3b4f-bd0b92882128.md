# ComboBox.AutoTab Property (Outlook Forms Script)

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that specifies whether an automatic tab occurs when a user enters the maximum allowable number of characters into the text box portion of a **[ComboBox](31e7c1de-ee4e-b3d9-4579-7fc6b215bad3.md)**. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AutoTab**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ComboBox** object.


## Remarks

 **True** if tab occurs, **False** otherwise (default).

The  **[MaxLength](81de6855-a108-c1c4-7fb6-df18b3236218.md)** property specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in the text box portion of a **ComboBox**.

You can specify the  **AutoTab** property for a **ComboBox** on a form for which you usually enter a set number of characters. Once a user enters the maximum number of characters, the focus automatically moves to the next control in the tab order. For example, if a **ComboBox** displays inventory stock numbers that are always five characters long, you can use **MaxLength** to specify the maximum number of characters to enter into the **ComboBox** and **AutoTab** to automatically tab to the next control after the user enters five characters.
