# Create a Rule to Move Specific E-mails to a Folder

This topic shows a code sample in Visual Basic for Applicatons (VBA) that uses the  **Rules** object model to create a rule. The code sample uses the **[RuleAction](6451788f-e5ed-239c-a34d-b564b52d8955.md)** and **[RuleCondition](e03f91c2-2c08-b036-104a-d6246f28bc2d.md)** objects to specify a rule that moves messages from a specific sender to a specific folder, unless the message contains certain terms in the subject. Note that the code sample assumes that there already exists a folder named "Dan" under the Inbox.

The following describes the steps used to create the rule:

1. Specify the target folder  `oMoveTarget` to move specific messages as determined by the condition and exception condition. The target folder is a subfolder named "Dan" under the Inbox, and is assumed to already exist.
    
2. Use  ** [Store.GetRules](06048799-e162-68f9-17c2-d80c25e2c55e.md)** to obtain a set of all the rules in the current session.
    
3. Using the  **[Rules](dd41b4de-bf5f-5532-46c9-394a5d078bec.md)** collection returned from the last step, use ** [Rules.Create](84789ccc-a6c2-9f79-5338-45b03b116dd5.md)** to add a new rule. The new rule specifies some action upon receiving a message, so it is of type **olRuleReceive**.
    
4. Using the  **[Rule](ea2ddbcc-fd65-a636-c6da-79950033f385.md)** object returned from the last step, use the ** [RuleConditions.From](3ebda0d0-ba44-95c6-ed02-a9c6acbf1f1c.md)** property to obtain a **[ToOrFromRuleCondition](ec5cae2a-cde8-5681-6a49-74e2f0226a4f.md)** object, `oFromCondition`.  `oFromCondition` specifies the condition for the rule: when a message is from `Dan Wilson`. 
    
5. Using the same  **Rule** object, use the ** [RuleActions.MoveToFolder](6d9c577d-e022-72fc-45f2-bdda7a8761de.md)** property to obtain a **[MoveOrCopyRuleAction](db951ad8-0d05-1696-acf4-c1da4fbdee33.md)** object, `oMoveRuleAction`.  `oMoveRuleAction` specifies the action for the rule: move the message to the target folder "Dan".
    
6. Using the same  **Rule** object, use the ** [RuleConditions.Subject](d6d51efb-9eec-0c07-ca8f-616791822f91.md)** property to obtain a **[TextRuleCondition](87e9ca00-7577-02c2-fb6f-a5dc2054ad8b.md)** object, `oExceptSubject`.  `oExceptSubject` specifies the exception condition: if the subject contains the terms "fun" or "chat", then do not apply the rule to move the message to the folder "Dan".
    
7. Use  ** [Rules.Save](d838eca0-4ec5-ab43-a031-fd65ab7d9f3c.md)** to save the new rule together with the rest of the rules for the current store.
