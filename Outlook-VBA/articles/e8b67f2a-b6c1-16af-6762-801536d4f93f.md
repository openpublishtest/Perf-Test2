Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that determines whether more than one address entry can be selected at a time in the **Select Names** dialog. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AllowMultipleSelection**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **SelectNamesDialog** object.


## Remarks

The default value of  **AllowMultipleSelection** is **True**. If  **AllowMultipleSelection** is set to **True**, the user can select multiple recipients by using the  **CTRL** or **SHIFT** key. If **AllowMultipleSelection** is set to **False**, multiple selection is disabled. 

Setting  **AllowMultipleSelection** to **False** does not ensure that only one recipient can be selected.
