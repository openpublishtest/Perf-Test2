# Rule Object (Outlook)

Represents an Outlook rule.


## Remarks

Both client and server side rules are represented by the  **Rule** object.

The Rules object model consists primarily of these objects:  **[Rules](dd41b4de-bf5f-5532-46c9-394a5d078bec.md)** , **Rule** , **[RuleActions](82ba76cd-86a4-3372-cb51-2df1d58c8b71.md)** , **[RuleConditions](e8e9a05a-b36b-add2-b294-8cdc5a97e119.md)** , **[RuleAction](6451788f-e5ed-239c-a34d-b564b52d8955.md)** , **[RuleCondition](e03f91c2-2c08-b036-104a-d6246f28bc2d.md)** , and the derived objects for certain rule actions and rule conditions. It provides partial parity with the Rules and Alerts Wizard in the Outlook user interface. Although it does not support creation of every single rule that you can possibly create using the Wizard, it supports the most commonly used rule actions and conditions.
