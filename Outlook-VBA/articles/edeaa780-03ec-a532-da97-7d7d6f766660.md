# TaskRequestItem.BeforeRead Event (Outlook)

Occurs before Microsoft Outlook begins to read the properties for the item.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **BeforeRead**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **TaskRequestItem** object.


## Remarks

The  **BeforeRead** event occurs before the **[Read](56fc2d07-6d17-874a-0734-db64fa4ccfd6.md)** event. Unlike other events with the Before prefix, this event is not cancelable. To determine when the item is unloaded from memory, use the **[Unload](9a8d0aad-8d39-32ae-945e-757c346e80d6.md)** event.

The  **BeforeRead** event corresponds to the Exchange Client Extensions (ECE) event **IExchExtMessageEvents::OnRead** .

Only the following members of the item object can be accessed in the  **BeforeRead** event:


-  **[Class](c3a5826a-37aa-1696-b19f-b1cb28cd4043.md)**
    
-  **[MessageClass](078d8ef9-ea60-f27c-ad68-da945f5b8fc8.md)**
    
-  **MAPIOBJECT**
    
The  **MAPIOBJECT** property is a hidden property in the Outlook object model. This property provides access to the underlying MAPI **[IMessage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc842097%28office.15%29.aspx)** object, and can be invoked only via the **[IUnknown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680509%28VS.85%29.aspx)** interface. The property is accessible to programs written in languages such as C or C++ that support **IUnknown** . **MAPIOBJECT** is not available through the **[IDispatch](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms221608.aspx)** interface. Development languages such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Visual C#, and Visual Basic support the **IDispatch** interface and not **IUnknown** , and therefore, they cannot access **MAPIOBJECT** . If other properties or methods of the parent item are accessed in this event, Outlook raises an error.

If the implementer accesses the underlying  **IMessage** object and changes properties on that object, Outlook will render that item reflecting the changes to the **IMessage** object. The implementer does not have to call **[SaveChanges](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc842181%28office.15%29.aspx)** on the **IMessage** object to cause the changes to be reflected in Outlook.

Implementers must release the object obtained from the  **MAPIOBJECT** property in the event before the event completes. Attempting to use that object outside the context of the event is unsupported and will lead to unpredictable behavior.
