# OlkComboBox.SelStart Property (Outlook)

Returns or sets a  **Long** that specifies either the starting point of the selected text or the insertion point if no text has been selected. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **SelStart**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **OlkComboBox** object.


## Remarks

The current selection is specified by  **[SelText](595b3e85-7d30-72bc-c1d4-b45c4492c221.md)** , which is a portion of the control's **[Value](742dd2a3-d3ef-46f9-4aca-5ebe8af17356.md)** . The maximum number of characters that can be supported for **Value** is **[MaxLength](87248b73-a6c5-0cc1-a711-13922195f406.md)** .

The default value is zero, which means no text is selected and the insertion point is at the beginning.

The  **SelStart** property is always valid, even when the control does not have focus. Setting **SelStart** to a value less than zero causes an error. Setting **SelStart** to a value greater than **MaxLength** will reset **SelStart** to **MaxLength** . Changing the value of **SelStart** cancels any existing selection, places the insertion point in the text, and sets the **SelLength** property to zero.
