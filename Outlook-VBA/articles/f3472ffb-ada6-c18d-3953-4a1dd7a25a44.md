## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Enabled**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **NewItemAlertRuleAction** object.


## Remarks

After you enable a rule, you must also save the rule by using  **[Rules.Save](d838eca0-4ec5-ab43-a031-fd65ab7d9f3c.md)** so that the rule and its enabled state will persist beyond the current session. A rule is only enabled after it has been saved successfully.
