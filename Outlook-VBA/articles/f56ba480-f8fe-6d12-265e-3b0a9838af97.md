# ListBox Object (Outlook Forms Script)

Displays a list of values and lets you select one or more.


## Remarks

If the  **ListBox** is bound to a data source, the **ListBox** stores the selected value in that data source.

The  **ListBox** can either appear as a list or as a group of **[OptionButton](8009dd64-44b5-3b66-e8d4-e3535e014396.md)** controls or **[CheckBox](1834855b-f96c-aaa1-24ce-81d1e4e4e1db.md)** controls.

The default property for a  **ListBox** is the **[Value](571ea3ea-57ed-71e4-75a0-d5e0cf7b9211.md)** property.

The default event for a  **ListBox** is the **[Click](a3b32670-d20c-a5cc-d236-041cbe155779.md)** event.

You can't drop text into a drop-down  **ListBox**.


### ListBox styles

You can choose between two presentation styles for a  **ListBox**. This is expressed by the  **[ListStyle](4abbd557-b80f-e940-873f-8527e30b4a2e.md)** property. Each style provides different ways for users to select items in the list.

If the style is 0, each item is on a separate row; the user selects an item by highlighting one or more rows.

If the style is 1, an  **OptionButton** or **CheckBox** appears at the beginning of each row. With this style, the user selects an item by clicking the option button or check box. Check boxes appear only when the **[MultiSelect](4ecc299b-0733-aa23-e820-f341ac80a0fa.md)** property is **True**.
