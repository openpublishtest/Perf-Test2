# Pre-address a Reply Form to a Public Folder or an E-mail Address

 **Note**  To pre-address a form to a public folder, you must first add the public folder to your Contacts folder. 


1. Open the type of form that you want to pre-address. 
    
2. Click  **To** on the form.
    
3. Next to  **Search**, select  **More Columns**. 
    
4. In the  **Search** box, type the e-mail address or the public folder that you want to appear in the **To** box on the form, and then click **OK**. 
    
5. On the  **Developer** tab, in the **Form** group, click **Design This Form** to open the form in design mode. If you do not see the **Developer** tab in the open contact, see [Run in Developer Mode in Outlook](8f81b1ce-333d-d9be-2af7-cfc65bf15e22.md).
    

 **Note**  Each person who uses the form must have permission to access the public folder that you specify in the  **To** field.
