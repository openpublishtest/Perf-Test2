 _expression_ A variable that represents an **[Account](f624438c-4e45-2822-18b6-bfe8074a33c0.md)** object.


## Remarks

This property is similar to the  **[ExchangeMailboxServerName](027d8d2d-612d-8eda-a6af-aa8dd371013e.md)** property of the **[NameSpace](f0dcaa19-07f5-5d42-a3bf-2e42b7885644.md)** object, except that this property applies to the Exchange Server that hosts the account mailbox, and not necessarily to the primary Exchange account.
