# SharingItem.Permission Property (Outlook)

Sets or returns an  **[OlPermission](11126d37-33da-53f7-f5b6-ea8603998651.md)** constant that determines what permissions to grant the recipients on the **[SharingItem](63dd3451-44f3-7cc4-c6e2-7dad5835a7d2.md)** . Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Permission**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **SharingItem** object.


## Remarks

The  **Permission** property should be synchronized with the **[PermissionTemplateGuid](166c2975-b6be-d1ca-4aa8-ad7deb42c68d.md)** property to accurately reflect the permission status of the **SharingItem** . Setting the **PermissionTemplateGuid** property to a valid GUID should also incur setting the **Permission** property to **OlPermission.olPermissionTemplate** .

 When no Information Rights Management (IRM) has been set up (in which case the **Permission** property is **OlPermission.olUnrestricted** ), or the restriction is not to forward the **SharingItem** (in which case the **Permission** property is **OlPermission.olDoNotForward** ), the value of the **PermissionTemplateGuid** property should be an empty string.

Although you can view content that is protected by IRM on any computer running the 2007 Microsoft Office system or a later version, you must have Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, or a later version of Outlook to create or send an e-mail that is protected by IRM.
