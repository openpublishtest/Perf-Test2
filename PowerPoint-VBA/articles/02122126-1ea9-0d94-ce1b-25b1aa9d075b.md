## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[ChartGroup](5caa5855-bd69-3fbc-f601-504e431a42e9.md)** object.


## Remarks

This property applies only to line charts. 


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example enables high-low lines for chart group one of the first chart in the active document and then sets line style, weight, and color. You should run the example on a 2-D line chart that has three series of stock-quote-like data (high-low-close).




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        With .Chart.ChartGroups(1)

            .HasHiLoLines = True

            With .HiLoLines.Border

                .LineStyle = xlThin

                .Weight = xlMedium

                .ColorIndex = 3

            End With

        End With

    End If

End With


```
