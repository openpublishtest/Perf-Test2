# ShapeNode Object (PowerPoint)

Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform.


## Remarks

 Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The **ShapeNode** object is a member of the **[ShapeNodes](493bacfe-eb8c-2064-46ec-c19e58e9b1ce.md)** collection. The **ShapeNodes** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.


## Example

Use  **Nodes** (index), where index is the node index number, to return a single **ShapeNode** object. If node one in shape three on `myDocument` is a corner point, the following example makes it a smooth point. For this example to work, shape three must be a freeform.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(3)

    If .Nodes(1).EditingType = msoEditingCorner Then

        .Nodes.SetEditingType 1, msoEditingSmooth

    End If

End With
```
