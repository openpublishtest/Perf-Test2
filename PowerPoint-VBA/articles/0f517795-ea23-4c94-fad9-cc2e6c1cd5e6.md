# SlideShowTransition.AdvanceOnClick Property (PowerPoint)

Determines whether the specified slide advances when it is clicked during a slide show. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AdvanceOnClick**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **SlideShowTransition** object.


### Return Value

MsoTriState


## Remarks

To set the slide to advance automatically after a certain amount of time elapses, set the  **[AdvanceOnTime](934c5acc-b230-2b7b-f0f2-4647cce5b62d.md)** property to **True** and set the **[AdvanceTime](79a120d2-5777-5eaa-a522-36e7d3bd539a.md)** property to the amount of time you want the slide to be shown. If you set both the **AdvanceOnClick** and the **AdvanceOnTime** properties to **True**, the slide advances either when it is clicked or when the specified amount of time has elapsed ? whichever comes first.

The value of the  **AdvanceOnClick** property can be one of these **MsoTriState** constants.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**msoFalse**|The specified slide does not advance when it is clicked during a slide show.|
|**msoTrue**| The specified slide advances when it is clicked during a slide show.|

## Example

This example sets slide one in the active presentation to advance after five seconds have passed or when the mouse is clicked ? whichever occurs first.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).SlideShowTransition

    .AdvanceOnClick = msoTrue

    .AdvanceOnTime = msoTrue

    .AdvanceTime = 5

End With
```
