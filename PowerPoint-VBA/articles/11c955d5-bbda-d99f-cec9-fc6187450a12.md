# LineFormat Object (PowerPoint)

Represents line and arrowhead formatting. For a line, the  **LineFormat** object contains formatting information for the line itself; for a shape with a border, this object contains formatting information for the shape's border.


## Example

Use the  **Line** property to return a **LineFormat** object. The following example adds a blue, dashed line to `myDocument`. There's a short, narrow oval at the line's starting point and a long, wide triangle at its endpoint.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes.AddLine(100, 100, 200, 300).Line

    .DashStyle = msoLineDashDotDot

    .ForeColor.RGB = RGB(50, 0, 128)

    .BeginArrowheadLength = msoArrowheadShort

    .BeginArrowheadStyle = msoArrowheadOval

    .BeginArrowheadWidth = msoArrowheadNarrow

    .EndArrowheadLength = msoArrowheadLong

    .EndArrowheadStyle = msoArrowheadTriangle

    .EndArrowheadWidth = msoArrowheadWide

End With
```
