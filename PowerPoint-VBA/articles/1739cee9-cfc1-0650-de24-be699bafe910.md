# Application.PresentationOpen Event (PowerPoint)

Occurs after an existing presentation is opened, as it is added to the  **[Presentations](0b952edc-8628-71ef-e854-3bcefbb3bc61.md)** collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **PresentationOpen**( **_Pres_** )

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Pres_|Required|**Presentation**|The presentation that is opened.|

## Remarks

For information about using events with the  **Application** object, see[How to: Use Events with the Application Object](b657ab62-67fa-4eeb-736c-86e31a026c73.md).

If your Visual Studio solution includes the  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint** reference, this event maps to the following types:


-  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.EApplication_PresentationOpenEventHandler** (the **PresentationOpen** delegate.)
    
-  **Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint.EApplication_Event.PresentationOpen** (the **PresentationOpen** event.)
    

## Example

This example modifies the background color for color scheme three, applies the modified color scheme to the presentation that was just opened, and displays the presentation in slide view.


```
Private Sub App_PresentationOpen(ByVal Pres As Presentation) 
    With Pres 
        Set CS3 = .ColorSchemes(3) 
        CS3.Colors(ppBackground).RGB = RGB(240, 115, 100) 
        With Windows(1) 
            .Selection.SlideRange.ColorScheme = CS3 
            .ViewType = ppViewSlide 
        End With 
    End With 
End Sub
```
