# View.Slide Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets a  **[Slide](afe42344-6898-00d2-ecc1-b0ed23a71fe8.md)** object that represents the slide that's currently displayed in the specified document window view. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Slide**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **View** object.


## Remarks

If the currently displayed slide is from an embedded presentation, you can use the  **[Parent](02925312-0c0b-b1b9-c353-7d559f0e0050.md)** property of the **Slide** object returned by the **Slide** property to return the embedded presentation that contains the slide. (The **[Presentation](9c05deb7-a385-540f-97a5-1c5510f120c6.md)** property of the **SlideShowWindow** object or **DocumentWindow** object returns the presentation from which the window was created, not the embedded presentation.)


## Example

This example places on the Clipboard a copy of the slide that's currently displayed in slide show window one.


```
SlideShowWindows(1).View.Slide.Copy
```

This example displays the name of the presentation currently running in slide show window one.




```
MsgBox SlideShowWindows(1).View.Slide.Parent.Name
```
