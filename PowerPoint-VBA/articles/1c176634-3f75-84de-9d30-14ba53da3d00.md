# Create Custom Dialog Boxes

Use the following procedure to create a custom dialog box:


1. [Create a UserForm](1ada0ef7-c238-32d6-3733-a006524fa618.md)
    
    On the  **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, click **UserForm**.
    
2. [Add controls to UserForms](bf39448d-5095-63dd-9b22-bbc3aa1391e1.md)
    
    Find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox** and drag the control onto the form.
    
3. [Set control properties](a1eda81e-61b3-0bcb-99b8-00e5fbd76f1f.md)
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click  **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
4. [Initialize the controls](d73b960d-bf78-1917-fc54-7b9b7cc7ca10.md)
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure before you show a form, or you can add code to the  **Initialize** event of the form.
    
5. [Write event procedures](b657ab62-67fa-4eeb-736c-86e31a026c73.md)
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a  **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
    
6. [Display the custom dialog box](25e27f90-d0d0-9d9c-fdf6-fc07c17c5da6.md)
    
    Use the  **Show** method to display a UserForm.
    
7. [Use control values while code is running](a885309e-4525-c866-114f-994b56bf0488.md)
    
    Some properties can be set at run time. Changes made to the dialog box by the user are lost when the dialog box is closed.
