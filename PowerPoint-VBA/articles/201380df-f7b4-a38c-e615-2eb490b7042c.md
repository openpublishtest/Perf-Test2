# FillFormat.GradientDegree Property (PowerPoint)

Returns a value that indicates how dark or light a one-color gradient fill is. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **GradientDegree**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **FillFormat** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks

A value of 0 (zero) means that black is mixed in with the shape's foreground color to form the gradient; a value of 1 means that white is mixed in; and values between 0 and 1 mean that a darker or lighter shade of the foreground color is mixed in. 

This property is read-only. Use the  **[OneColorGradient](ce574185-2d13-993b-4a78-d681b6600621.md)** method to set the gradient degree for the fill.


## Example

This example adds a rectangle to  `myDocument` and sets the degree of its fill gradient to match that of the shape named "Rectangle 2." If Rectangle 2 doesn't have a one-color gradient fill, this example fails.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes

    gradDegree1 = .Item("Rectangle 2").Fill.GradientDegree

    With .AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 0, 0, 40, 80).Fill

        .ForeColor.RGB = RGB(128, 0, 0)

        .OneColorGradient msoGradientHorizontal, 1, gradDegree1

    End With

End With
```
