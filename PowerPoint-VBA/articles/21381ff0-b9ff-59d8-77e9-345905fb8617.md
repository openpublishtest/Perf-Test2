# ActionSetting Object (PowerPoint)

Contains information about how the specified shape or text range reacts to mouse actions during a slide show. 


## Remarks

The  **ActionSetting** object is a member of the **[ActionSettings](8914c203-6b8d-fa80-16ad-7015595657b7.md)** collection. The **ActionSettings** collection contains one **ActionSetting** object that represents how the specified object reacts when the user clicks it during a slide show and one **ActionSetting** object that represents how the specified object reacts when the user moves the mouse pointer over it during a slide show.

If you've set properties of the  **ActionSetting** object that don't seem to be taking effect, make sure that you've set the[Action](32ed5574-5ac0-abb7-d300-6644fc894ec1.md) property to the appropriate value.


## Example

Use  **ActionSettings** (index), where index is the either **ppMouseClick** or **ppMouseOver**, to return a single **ActionSetting** object. The following example sets the mouse-click action for the text in the third shape on slide one in the active presentation to an Internet link.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3) _ 
        .TextFrame.TextRange.ActionSettings(ppMouseClick) 
    .Action = ppActionHyperlink 
    .Hyperlink.Address = "http://www.microsoft.com" 
End With
```
