# Pane Object (PowerPoint)

An object representing one of the three panes in normal view or the single pane of any other view in the document window.


## Remarks

Use  **Panes** (index), where index is the index number for a pane, to return a single **Pane** object. The following table lists the names of the panes in normal view with their corresponding index numbers.



|**Pane**|**Index number**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Outline|1|
|Slide|2|
|Notes|3|
When using a document window view other than normal view, use  **Panes** (1) to reference the single **Pane** object.

Use the [Activate](3571e13c-413b-ca86-51a7-38d2a1caab0f.md)method to make the specified pane active.

Use the [ViewType](6114b581-a9f5-a4b7-827e-99004fea4e58.md)property to determine which pane is active. 

Normal view is the only view with multiple panes. All other document window views have only a single pane, which is the document window.


## Example

The following example uses the  **ViewType** property to determine whether the slide pane is the active pane. If it is, then the **Activate** method makes the notes pane the active pane.


```
With ActiveWindow

    If .ActivePane.ViewType = ppViewSlide Then

        .Panes(3).Activate

    End If

End With
```
