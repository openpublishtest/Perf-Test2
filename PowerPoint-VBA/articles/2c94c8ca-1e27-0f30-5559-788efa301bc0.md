# ErrorBars Object (PowerPoint)

Represents the error bars on a chart series.


## Remarks

 Error bars indicate the degree of uncertainty for chart data. Only series in area, bar, column, line, and scatter groups on a 2-D chart can have error bars. Only series in scatter groups can have x and y error bars. This object is not a collection. There is no object that represents a single error bar; you either enable x error bars or y error bars for all points in a series or you disable them.

The  **[ErrorBar](a25795b8-a954-0803-bea6-6c650190ad3f.md)** method changes the error bar format and type.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

Use the  **[ErrorBars](6d3a4bd3-93f1-95d6-6d8e-4f296c1b5f95.md)** property to return the **ErrorBars** object. The following example enables error bars for series one of the first chart in the active document and then sets the end style for the error bars.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).HasErrorBars = True

        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).ErrorBars.EndStyle = xlNoCap

    End If

End With
```
