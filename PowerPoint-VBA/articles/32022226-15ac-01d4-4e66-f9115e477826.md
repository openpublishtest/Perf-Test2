sngHeight = Windows(1).Height                     ' available height

sngWidth = Windows(1).Width + Windows(2).Width    ' available width

With Windows(1)

    .Width = sngWidth

    .Height = sngHeight / 2

    .Left = 0

End With

With Windows(2)

    .Width = sngWidth

    .Height = sngHeight / 2

    .Top = sngHeight / 2

    .Left = 0

End With
