# View Object (PowerPoint)

Represents the current editing view in the specified document window.


## Remarks




 **Note**  The  **View** object can represent any of the document window views: normal view, slide view, outline view, slide sorter view, notes page view, slide master view, handout master view, or notes master view. Some properties and methods of the **View** object work only in certain views. If you try to use a property or method that's inappropriate for a **View** object, an error occurs.


## Example

Use the [View](6488ba10-744a-eb88-df8d-bf85e2f6711d.md)property of the  **[DocumentWindow](567c5e66-8d68-a868-4072-b5358cf69546.md)** object to return the **View** object. The following example sets the size of window one and then sets the zoom to fit the new window size.


```
With Windows(1)

    .Height = 200

    .Width = 250

    .View.ZoomToFit = True

End With
```
