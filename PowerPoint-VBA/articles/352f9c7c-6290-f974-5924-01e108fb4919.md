Returns the number of connection sites on the specified shape. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ConnectionSiteCount**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ShapeRange** object.


### Return Value

Long


## Example

This example adds two rectangles to  `myDocument` and joins them with two connectors. The beginnings of both connectors attach to connection site one on the first rectangle; the ends of the connectors attach to the first and last connection sites of the second rectangle.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

Set s = myDocument.Shapes

Set firstRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 100, 50, 200, 100)

Set secondRect = s.AddShape(msoShapeRectangle, 300, 300, 200, 100)

lastsite = secondRect.ConnectionSiteCount

With s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, 0, 0, 100, 100) _

        .ConnectorFormat

    .BeginConnect ConnectedShape:=firstRect, ConnectionSite:=1

    .EndConnect ConnectedShape:=secondRect, ConnectionSite:=1

End With

With s.AddConnector(msoConnectorCurve, 0, 0, 100, 100) _

        .ConnectorFormat

    .BeginConnect ConnectedShape:=firstRect, ConnectionSite:=1

    .EndConnect ConnectedShape:=secondRect, _

        ConnectionSite:=lastsite

End With
```
