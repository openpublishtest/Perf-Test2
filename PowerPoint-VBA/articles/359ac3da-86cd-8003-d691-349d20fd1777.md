# Effect Object (PowerPoint)

Represents timing information about a slide animation.


## Example

Use the [AddEffect](fea5ac1e-83ae-2241-bf3a-8cfdd8354791.md)method to add an effect. This example adds a shape to the first slide in the active presentation and adds an effect and a behavior to the shape.


```
Sub NewShapeAndEffect()

    Dim shpStar As Shape

    Dim sldOne As Slide

    Dim effNew As Effect



    Set sldOne = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

    Set shpStar = sldOne.Shapes.AddShape(Type:=msoShape5pointStar, _

        Left:=150, Top:=72, Width:=400, Height:=400)

    Set effNew = sldOne.TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect(Shape:=shpStar, _

        EffectId:=msoAnimEffectStretchy, Trigger:=msoAnimTriggerAfterPrevious)

    With effNew

        With .Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeScale).ScaleEffect

            .FromX = 75

            .FromY = 75

            .ToX = 0

            .ToY = 0

        End With

        .Timing.AutoReverse = msoTrue

    End With

End Sub
```

To refer to an existing  **Effect** object, use **[MainSequence](b71f83ad-6d92-cc10-9692-a7567ca0a077.md)** (index), where index is the number of the **Effect** object in the **[Sequence](37a5224f-2461-b575-acb6-6905bbb5136d.md)** collection. This example changes the effect for the first sequence and specifies the behavior for that effect.




```
Sub ChangeEffect()

    With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine _

        .MainSequence(1)

        .EffectType = msoAnimEffectSpin

        With .Behaviors(1).RotationEffect

            .From = 100

            .To = 360

            .By = 5

        End With

    End With

End Sub
```
