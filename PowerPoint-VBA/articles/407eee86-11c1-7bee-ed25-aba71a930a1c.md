# Shapes.AddConnector Method (PowerPoint)

Creates a connector. Returns a  **[Shape](1da93849-99e0-827e-ced3-c6cf7f8569f3.md)** object that represents the new connector. When a connector is added, it is not connected to anything. Use the **[BeginConnect](d8762e6c-e628-b290-9847-a60bdd1f297e.md)** and **[EndConnect](b1a864e3-c2c2-ceeb-ac7c-5a26e7248dbe.md)** methods to attach the beginning and end of a connector to other shapes in the document.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AddConnector**( **_Type_**, **_BeginX_**, **_BeginY_**, **_EndX_**, **_EndY_** )

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Shapes** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Type_|Required|**[MsoConnectorType](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2c67963f-5cb3-295d-fdf4-df33a283f1af%28Office.15%29.aspx)**|The type of connector.|
| _BeginX_|Required|**Single**|The horizontal position, measured in points, of the connector's starting point relative to the left edge of the slide.|
| _BeginY_|Required|**Single**|The vertical position, measured in points, of the connector's starting point relative to the top edge of the slide.|
| _EndX_|Required|**Single**|The horizontal position, measured in points, of the connector's ending point relative to the left edge of the slide.|
| _EndY_|Required|**Single**|The vertical position, measured in points, of the connector's ending point relative to the top edge of the slide.|

### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

When you attach a connector to a shape, the size and position of the connector are automatically adjusted, if necessary. Therefore, if you're going to attach a connector to other shapes, the position and dimensions you specify when adding the connector are irrelevant.


## Example

This example adds two rectangles to myDocument and connects them with a curved connector. Note that when you attach the connector to the rectangles, the size and position of the connector are automatically adjusted; therefore, the position and dimensions you specify when adding the callout are irrelevant (dimensions must be nonzero).


```
Sub NewConnector() 
 
    Dim shpShapes As Shapes 
    Dim shpFirst As Shape 
    Dim shpSecond As Shape 
 
    Set shpShapes = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes 
    Set shpFirst = shpShapes.AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, _ 
        Left:=100, Top:=50, Width:=200, Height:=100) 
    Set shpSecond = shpShapes.AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, _ 
        Left:=300, Top:=300, Width:=200, Height:=100) 
    With shpShapes.AddConnector(Type:=msoConnectorCurve, BeginX:=0, _ 
            BeginY:=0, EndX:=100, EndY:=100).ConnectorFormat 
        .BeginConnect ConnectedShape:=shpFirst, ConnectionSite:=1 
        .EndConnect ConnectedShape:=shpSecond, ConnectionSite:=1 
        .Parent.RerouteConnections 
    End With 
 
End Sub
```
