# PrintOptions.RangeType Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets the type of print range for the presentation. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RangeType**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **PrintOptions** object.


## Remarks

The value of the  **RangeType** property can be one of these **PpSlideShowRangeType** constants.

|:-----|
|**ppShowAll**|
|**ppShowNamedSlideShow**|
|**ppShowSlideRange**|
To print the slides ranges you've defined in the  **[PrintRanges](5c1e9dc1-e30c-bc65-5283-448b95795b11.md)** collection, you must first set the **RangeType** property to **ppPrintSlideRange**. Setting **RangeType** to anything other than **ppPrintSlideRange** means that the ranges you've defined in the **PrintRanges** collection won't be applied. However, this doesn't affect the contents of the **PrintRanges** collection in any way. That is, if you define some print ranges, set the **RangeType** property to a value other than **ppPrintSlideRange**, and then later set **RangeType** back to **ppPrintSlideRange**, the print ranges you defined before will remain unchanged.

Specifying a value for the To and From arguments of the  **[PrintOut](57685390-43c1-4bd4-d2ee-ba34641e34c5.md)** method sets the value of this property.


## Example

This example prints the current slide the active presentation.


```
With ActivePresentation

    .PrintOptions.RangeType = ppPrintCurrent

    .PrintOut

End With
```
