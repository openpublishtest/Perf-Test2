Use the [PlaySettings](2cfd1ed9-7ed0-0f69-4df5-43aa22e37f46.md)property to return the  **PlaySettings** object.

    .AddMediaObject(FileName:="C:\WINNT\clock.avi", _

    Left:=20, Top:=20)

With clockMovie.AnimationSettings.PlaySettings

    .PlayOnEntry = True

    .PauseAnimation = False

    .HideWhileNotPlaying = True

End With
