# PrintRanges Object (PowerPoint)

A collection of all the  **[PrintRange](62f098b3-5e67-8fa4-3af9-4507160fa1ad.md)** objects in the specified presentation. Each **PrintRange** object represents a range of consecutive slides or pages to be printed.


## Example

Use the [Ranges](d0011261-a663-534d-204f-af2cd02f72be.md)property to return the  **PrintRanges** collection. The following example clears all previously defined print ranges from the collection for the active presentation.


```
ActivePresentation.PrintOptions.Ranges.ClearAll
```

Use the [Add](e5b50370-699b-b904-8ce7-b825f29d0682.md)method to create a  **PrintRange** object and add it to the **PrintRanges** collection. The following example defines three print ranges that represent slide 1, slides 3 through 5, and slides 8 and 9 in the active presentation and then prints the slides in these ranges.




```
With ActivePresentation.PrintOptions

    .RangeType = ppPrintSlideRange

    With .Ranges

        .ClearAll

        .Add 1, 1

        .Add 3, 5

        .Add 8, 9

    End With

End With

ActivePresentation.PrintOut
```

Use  **Ranges** (index), where index is the print range index number, to return a single **PrintRange** object. The following example displays a message that indicates the starting and ending slide numbers for print range one in the active presentation.




```
With ActivePresentation.PrintOptions.Ranges

    If .Count > 0 Then

        With .Item(1)

            MsgBox "Print range 1 starts on slide " &amp; .Start &amp; _

                " and ends on slide " &amp; .End

        End With

    End If

End With
```
