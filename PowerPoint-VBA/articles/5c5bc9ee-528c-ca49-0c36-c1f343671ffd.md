Returns or sets the name of the presentation or macro to be run when the specified shape is clicked or the mouse pointer passes over the shape during a slide show. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Run**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **ActionSetting** object.


### Return Value

## Remarks

 For this property to affect the slide show action, you must set the **[Action](32ed5574-5ac0-abb7-d300-6644fc894ec1.md)** property value to **ppActionRunMacro** or **ppActionRunProgram**.

If the value of the  **Action** property is **ppActionRunMacro**, the specified string value should be the name of a global macro that's currently loaded. If the value of the **Action** property is **ppActionRunProgram**, the specified string value should be the full path and file name of a program.

You can set the  **Run** property to a macro that takes no arguments or a macro that takes a single Shape or Object argument. The shape that was clicked during the slide show will be passed as this argument.


## Example

This example specifies that the CalculateTotal macro be run whenever the mouse pointer passes over the shape during a slide show.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1) _

    .Shapes(3).ActionSettings(ppMouseOver)

        .Action = ppActionRunMacro

        .Run = "CalculateTotal"

        .AnimateAction = True

End With
```
