# Presentation.Path Property (PowerPoint)

Returns a  **String** that represents the path to the specified **[Presentation](ec75cf52-69f8-d35b-0a26-4a8da8a9683f.md)** object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Path**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Presentation** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

If you use this property to return a path for a presentation that has not been saved, it returns an empty string.

The path doesn't include the final backslash (\) or the name of the specified object. Use the  **Name** property of the **Presentation** object to return the file name without the path, and use the **FullName** property to return the file name and the path together.


## Example

This example saves the active presentation in the same folder as PowerPoint. 


```
With Application

    fName = .Path &amp; "\test presentation"

    ActivePresentation.SaveAs fName

End With
```
