# AnimationBehavior Object (PowerPoint)

Represents the behavior of an animation effect, the main animation sequence, or an interactive animation sequence. The  **AnimationBehavior** object is a member of the **[AnimationBehaviors](40e11093-5cbd-c8d3-04b5-4cd7de97bfa7.md)** collection.


## Example

Use [Behaviors](e5335758-2f92-ccbc-a665-b6d5947e79f2.md)(index), where index is the number of the behavior in the sequence of behaviors, to return a single  **AnimationBehavior** object. The following example sets the positions of the a rotation's starting and ending points. This example assumes that the first behavior for the main animation sequence is a **[RotationEffect](d0fc5520-dbbd-a44a-b811-51fd299c4587.md)** object.


```
Sub Change()

    With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence(1) _

            .Behaviors(1).RotationEffect

        .From = 1

        .To = 180

    End With

End Sub
```
