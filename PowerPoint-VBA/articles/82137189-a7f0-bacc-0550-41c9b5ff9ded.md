# Timing.AutoReverse Property (PowerPoint)

Determines whether an effect should play forward and then in reverse, thereby doubling its duration. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AutoReverse**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Timing** object.


### Return Value

MsoTriState


## Remarks

The value of the  **AutoReverse** property can be one of these **MsoTriState** constants.



|**Constant**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**msoFalse**| The default. The effect does not play forward and then in reverse.|
|**msoTrue**| The effect plays forward and then in reverse.|

## Example

The following example adds a shape and an animation effect to it; then it sets the animation to reverse direction after it finishes its forward movement.


```
Sub SetEffectTiming()



    Dim effDiamond As Effect

    Dim shpRectangle As Shape



    'Adds rectangle and applies diamond effect

    Set shpRectangle = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes.AddShape _

        (Type:=msoShapeRectangle, Left:=100, _

        Top:=100, Width:=50, Height:=50)

    Set effDiamond = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine _

        .MainSequence.AddEffect(Shape:=shpRectangle, _

         effectId:=msoAnimEffectPathDiamond)



    'Sets the duration of and reverses the effect

    With effDiamond.Timing

        .Duration = 5 ' Length of effect.

        .AutoReverse = msoTrue

    End With



End Sub
```
