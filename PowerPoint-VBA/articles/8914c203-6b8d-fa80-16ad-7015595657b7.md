# ActionSettings Object (PowerPoint)

A collection that contains the two  **[ActionSetting](21381ff0-b9ff-59d8-77e9-345905fb8617.md)** objects for a shape or text range. One **ActionSetting** object represents how the specified object reacts when the user clicks it during a slide show, and the other **ActionSetting** object represents how the specified object reacts when the user moves the mouse pointer over it during a slide show.


## Example

Use the [ActionSettings](67e76de6-c0c3-7a35-f01e-e1cab4eb13d3.md)property to return the  **ActionSettings** collection. Use **ActionSettings** (index), where index is either **ppMouseClick** or **ppMouseOver**, to return a single **ActionSetting** object. The following example specifies that the CalculateTotal macro be run whenever the mouse pointer passes over the shape during a slide show.


```
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3) _

        .ActionSettings(ppMouseOver)

    .Action = ppActionRunMacro

    .Run = "CalculateTotal"

    .AnimateAction = True

End With
```
