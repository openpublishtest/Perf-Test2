# Application.WindowDeactivate Event (PowerPoint)

Occurs when the application window or any document window is deactivated.


## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Pres_|Required|**Presentation**|The presentation displayed in the deactivated window.|
| _Wn_|Required|**DocumentWindow**|The deactivated document window.|

```
Private Sub App_WindowDeactivate (ByVal Pres As Presentation, ByVal Wn As DocumentWindow)

    FindNum = InStr(1, Wn.Presentation.FullName, ".")

    If FindNum = 0 Then

        HTMLName = Wn.Presentation.FullName &amp; ".htm"

    Else

        HTMLName = Mid(Wn.Presentation.FullName, 1, FindNum - 1) _

            &amp; ".htm"

    End If

    Wn.Presentation.SaveCopyAs HTMLName, ppSaveAsHTML

    MsgBox "Presentation being saved in HTML format as " _

        &amp; HTMLName &amp; " ."

End Sub


```
