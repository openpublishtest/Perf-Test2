## Remarks

Actions which trigger this event would include actions such as modifying a slide's or slide master's color scheme, or applying a template.

To access the  **Application** events, declare an **Application** variable in the General Declarations section of your code. Then set the variable equal to the **Application** object for which you want to access events. For information about using events with the Microsoft PowerPoint **Application** object, see[How to: Use Events with the Application Object](b657ab62-67fa-4eeb-736c-86e31a026c73.md).


## Example

This example displays a message when the color scheme for the selected slide or slides is changed. This example assumes an  **Application** object called PPTApp has been declared by using the **WithEvents** keyword.


```
Private Sub PPTApp_ColorSchemeChanged(ByVal SldRange As SlideRange)



    If SldRange.Count = 1 Then

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _

            &amp; SldRange.Name &amp; "."

    Else

        MsgBox "You've changed the color scheme for " _

            &amp; SldRange.Count &amp; " slides."

    End If
