# ThreeDFormat.RotationX Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis, in degrees. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RotationX**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ThreeDFormat** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks

Can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates upward rotation; a negative value indicates downward rotation.

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, use the  **[RotationY](1e39544d-e95d-7419-8d6b-140696a43895.md)** property of the **ThreeDFormat** object.

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the  **[Rotation](3ed090a8-d945-85ee-155b-08628feff348.md)** property of the **[Shape](1da93849-99e0-827e-ced3-c6cf7f8569f3.md)** object.

To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the  **[SetExtrusionDirection](3ce76681-1a37-258b-594c-11d1d4f161c6.md)** method.


## Example

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to  `myDocument` and sets their rotation around the x-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes

    With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD

        .Visible = True

        .RotationX = -30

    End With

    With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 90, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD

        .Visible = True

        .RotationX = 0

    End With

    With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 150, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD

        .Visible = True

        .RotationX = 30

    End With

End With
```
