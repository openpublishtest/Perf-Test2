# PublishObject Object (PowerPoint)

Represents a complete or partial loaded presentation that is available for publishing to HTML. The  **PublishObject** object is a member of the **[PublishObjects](7f32fe4e-2345-ce6c-77c9-9fabdf9c5a23.md)** collection.


## Remarks

You can specify the content and attributes of the published presentation by setting various properties of the  **PublishObject** object. For example, the[SourceType](3714155e-b42f-8396-af66-6a1635f8631a.md)property defines the portion of a loaded presentation to be published. The [RangeStart](c7b576f4-f001-994a-ef36-0ed9402960a2.md)property and the [RangeEnd](3edce18e-31c5-4585-9ca5-adb8cbdbca17.md)property specify the range of slides to publish, and the [SpeakerNotes](2dabb3db-4f94-c640-2c4d-d6c10551f903.md)property designates whether or not to publish the speaker's notes.


## Example

Use  **PublishObjects** (index), where index is always "1", to return the single object for a loaded presentation. There can be only one **PublishObject** object for each loaded presentation. This example publishes slides three through five of presentation two to HTML. It names the published presentation Mallard.htm.


```
With Presentations(2).PublishObjects(1)

    .FileName = "C:\Test\Mallard.htm"

    .SourceType = ppPublishSlideRange

    .RangeStart = 3

    .RangeEnd = 5

    .Publish

End With
```
