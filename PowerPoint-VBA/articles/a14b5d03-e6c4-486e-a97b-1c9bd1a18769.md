## Remarks

Exporting a presentation doesn't set the  **[Saved](52798ca6-e181-cf82-d397-647404235cb9.md)** property of a presentation to **True**.

PowerPoint uses the specified graphics filter to save each individual slide. The names of the slides exported and saved to disk are determined by PowerPoint. They are typically saved by using the following naming convention: Slide1.wmf, Slide2.wmf. The path of the saved files is specified in the FileName argument.
