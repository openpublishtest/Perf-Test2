# SlideShowView.Previous Method (PowerPoint)

Shows the slide immediately preceding the slide that's currently displayed. 


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Previous**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **SlideShowView** object.


## Remarks

If you are currently on the first slide in a kiosk slide show, the  **Previous** method takes you to the last slide in a slide show; otherwise, it has no effect if the first slide in the presentation is currently displayed. Use the **[View](ebf565af-fc90-ab1b-0e05-6dcb90a7c2d2.md)** property of the **SlideShowWindow** object to return the **SlideShowView** object.


## Example

This example shows the slide immediately preceding the currently displayed slide on slide show window one.


```
SlideShowWindows(1).View.Previous
```
