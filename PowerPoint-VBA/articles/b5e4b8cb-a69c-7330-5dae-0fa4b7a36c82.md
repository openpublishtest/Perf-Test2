## Example

If the end of the connector represented by shape three on the first slide in the active presentation is connected to a shape, this example stores the connection site number in the variable  `oldEndConnSite`, stores a reference to the connected shape in the object variable  `oldEndConnShape`, and then disconnects the end of the connector from the shape.


```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(3)

    If .Connector Then

        With .ConnectorFormat

            If .EndConnected Then

                oldEndConnSite = .EndConnectionSite

                Set oldEndConnShape = .EndConnectedShape

                .EndDisconnect

            End If

        End With

    End If

End With
```
