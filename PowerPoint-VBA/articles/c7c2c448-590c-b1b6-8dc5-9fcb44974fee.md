```
Set myDocument = ActivePresentation.Slides(1)

With myDocument.Shapes(3)

    If .Connector Then

        With .ConnectorFormat

            If .BeginConnected Then

                oldBeginConnSite = .BeginConnectionSite

                Set oldBeginConnShape = .BeginConnectedShape

                .BeginDisconnect

            End If

        End With

    End If

End With
```
