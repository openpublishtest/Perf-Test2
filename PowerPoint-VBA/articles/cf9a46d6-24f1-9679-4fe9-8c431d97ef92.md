# TextStyleLevel Object (PowerPoint)

Contains character and paragraph formatting information for an outline level. 


## Remarks

The  **TextStyleLevel** object is a member of the **[TextStyleLevels](dc61e97f-e92e-d214-47af-5830c14b1b09.md)** collection. The **TextStyleLevels** collection contains one **TextStyleLevel** object for each of the five outline levels.


## Example

Use  **Levels** (index), where index is a number from 1 through 5 that corresponds to the outline level, to return a single **TextStyleLevel** object. The following example sets the font name and font size, the space before paragraphs, and the paragraph alignment for level-one body text on all the slides in the active presentation.


```
With ActivePresentation.SlideMaster _

        .TextStyles(ppBodyStyle).Levels(1)

    With .Font

        .Name = "Arial"

        .Size = 36

    End With

    With .ParagraphFormat

        .LineRuleBefore = False

        .SpaceBefore = 14

        .Alignment = ppAlignJustify

    End With

End With
```
