# MotionEffect.FromY Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the vertical position of a **[MotionEffect](77a34f68-8806-22b8-149f-c28e0457e7e9.md)** object, specified as a percentage of the screen width. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **FromY**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **MotionEffect** object.


### Return Value

Single


## Remarks

The default value of this property is  **Empty**, in which case the current position of the object is used.

Use this property in conjunction with the  **ToY** property to resize or jump from one position to another.

Do not confuse this property with the  **From** property of the **[ColorEffect](c21ca9cd-3aaa-35f7-3d0e-89ca155322f2.md)**, **[RotationEffect](d0fc5520-dbbd-a44a-b811-51fd299c4587.md)**, or **[PropertyEffect](8fa129ac-f222-a01c-4545-0097b1164aee.md)** objects, which is used to set or change colors, rotations, or other properties of an animation behavior, respectively.


## Example

The following example adds an animation path and sets the starting and ending horizontal and vertical positions.


```
Sub AddMotionPath()



    Dim effCustom As Effect

    Dim animMotion As AnimationBehavior

    Dim shpRectangle As Shape



    'Adds shape and sets effect and animation properties

    Set shpRectangle = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes _

        .AddShape(Type:=msoShapeRectangle, Left:=100, _

        Top:=100, Width:=50, Height:=50)

    Set effCustom = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence _

        .AddEffect(Shape:=shpRectangle, effectId:=msoAnimEffectCustom)

    Set animMotion = effCustom.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeMotion)



    'Sets starting and ending horizontal and vertical positions

    With animMotion.MotionEffect

        .FromX = 0

        .FromY = 0

        .ToX = 50

        .ToY = 50

    End With



End Sub
```
