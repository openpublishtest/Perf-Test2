# AnimationSettings Object (PowerPoint)

Represents the special effects applied to the animation for the specified shape during a slide show.


## Example

Use the [AnimationSettings](c960d0de-afb3-55f2-b6fb-e67779cc42d2.md)property of the  **Shape** object to return the **AnimationSettings** object. The following example adds a slide that contains both a title and a three-item list to the active presentation, and then it sets the list to be animated by first-level paragraphs, to fly in from the left when animated, to dim to the specified color after being animated, and to animate its items in reverse order.


```
Set sObjs = ActivePresentation.Slides.Add(2, ppLayoutText).Shapes

sObjs.Title.TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "Top Three Reasons"

With sObjs.Placeholders(2)

    .TextFrame.TextRange.Text = _

        "Reason 1" &amp; VBNewLine &amp; "Reason 2" &amp; VBNewLine &amp; "Reason 3"

    With .AnimationSettings

        .TextLevelEffect = ppAnimateByFirstLevel

        .EntryEffect = ppEffectFlyFromLeft

        .AfterEffect = ppAfterEffectDim

        .DimColor.RGB = RGB(100, 120, 100)

        .AnimateTextInReverse = True

    End With

End With
```
