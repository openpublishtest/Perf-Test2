# ColorEffect.By Property (PowerPoint)

Returns a  **ColorFormat** object that represents a change to the color of the object by the specified number, expressed in RGB format. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **By**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ColorEffect** object.


## Remarks

Do not confuse this property with the  **ByX** or **ByY** properties of the **[ScaleEffect](cb7c296e-a9ea-4ed6-87e0-a5d603da4f9f.md)** and **[MotionEffect](77a34f68-8806-22b8-149f-c28e0457e7e9.md)** objects, which are only used for scaling or motion effects.


## Example

This example adds a color effect and changes its color. This example assumes there is at least one shape on the first slide of the active presentation.


```
Sub AddAndChangeColorEffect()

    Dim effBlinds As Effect

    Dim tmlnShape As TimeLine

    Dim shpShape As Shape

    Dim animBehavior As AnimationBehavior

    Dim clrEffect As ColorEffect



    'Sets shape, timing, and effect

    Set shpShape = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1)

    Set tmlnShape = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine

    Set effBlinds = tmlnShape.MainSequence.AddEffect _

        (Shape:=shpShape, effectId:=msoAnimEffectBlinds)



    'Adds animation behavior and color effect

    Set animBehavior = tmlnShape.MainSequence(1).Behaviors _

        .Add(Type:=msoAnimTypeColor)

    Set clrEffect = animBehavior.ColorEffect



    'Specifies color

    clrEffect.By.RGB = RGB(Red:=255, Green:=0, Blue:=0)

End Sub
```
