    Dim sldNew As Slide

    Dim shpCanvas As Shape



    'Create a new slide with a drawing canvas and shapes

    Set sldNew = Presentations(1).Slides _

        .Add(Index:=1, Layout:=ppLayoutBlank)

    Set shpCanvas = sldNew.Shapes.AddCanvas( _

        Left:=100, Top:=100, Width:=200, Height:=200)



    With shpCanvas.CanvasItems

        .AddShape msoShapeRectangle, Left:=0, Top:=0, _

            Width:=100, Height:=100

        .AddShape msoShapeOval, Left:=0, Top:=50, _

            Width:=100, Height:=100

        .AddShape msoShapeDiamond, Left:=0, Top:=100, _

            Width:=100, Height:=100

    End With



    'Select all shapes in the canvas

    shpCanvas.CanvasItems.SelectAll



    'Fill canvas child shapes with a pattern

    With ActiveWindow.Selection



        If .HasChildShapeRange = True Then

            .ChildShapeRange.Fill.Patterned Pattern:=msoPatternDivot

        Else

            MsgBox "This is not a range of child shapes."

        End If



    End With



End Sub
