# ChartBorder Object (PowerPoint)

Represents the border of an object.


## Remarks

Most bordered objects have a border that is treated as a single entity, regardless of how many sides it has. The entire border must be returned as a unit. To return a  **Border** object, use the **Border** property for the particular bordered object (for example, the **[Border](3bfc2237-65b9-9ce1-8ee7-ccdab89f7f1b.md)** property of a **[TrendLine](74755c19-0a7d-cbbf-857e-78740adf6aa4.md)** object).


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

 The following example changes the type and line style of a trendline on the active chart.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Trendlines(1)

    .Type = xlLinear

    .Border.LineStyle = xlDash

End With
```
