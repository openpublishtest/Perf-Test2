# Series.Values Property (PowerPoint)

Returns or sets a collection of all the values in the series. Read/write  **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Values**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Series](5c8c2d92-d8ca-4d21-e213-c374292275d4.md)** object.


## Remarks

The value of this property can be either the address of a range on the chart's worksheet or an array of constant values, but not a combination of both. See the examples for details.


## Example




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

The following example sets the series values from a range address.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = "=Sheet1!B2:B5"

    End If

End With
```




 **Note**  Although the following code applies to Microsoft Word, you can readily modify it to apply to PowerPoint.

To assign a constant value to each individual data point, you must use an array, as shown in the following example.




```
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1)

    If .HasChart Then

        .Chart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = _

            Array(1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)

    End If

End With
```
