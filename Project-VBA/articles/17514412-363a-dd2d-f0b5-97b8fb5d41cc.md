The process continues until the row is empty, and then shows a message box with the test results for each row.


```
Sub ShowGroupByItems() 
 Dim isValid As Boolean 
 Dim res As Resource 
 Dim rowType As String 
 Dim msg As String 
 
 isValid = True 
 msg = "" 
 
 ActiveProject.Views("Resource Sheet").Apply 
 GroupApply Name:="Complete and Incomplete Resources" 
 Application.SelectBeginning 
 
 ' When a cell in an empty row is selected, accessing the ActiveCell.Resource 
 ' property results in error 1004. 
 On Error Resume Next 
 
 ' Loop until a cell in an empty row is selected. 
 While isValid 
 Set res = ActiveCell.Resource 
 
 If Err.Number > 0 Then 
 isValid = False 
 Debug.Print Err.Number 
 Err.Number = 0 
 Else 
 If res.GroupBySummary Then 
 rowType = "' is a group-by summary row." 
 Else 
 rowType = "' is a resource row." 
 End If 
 
 msg = msg &amp; "Resource name: '" &amp; res.Name &amp; rowType &amp; vbCrLf 
 SelectCellDown 
 End If 
 Wend 
 
 MsgBox msg, vbInformation, "GroupBy Summary for Resources"
