# Subproject Object (Project)



Represents a subproject. The  **Subproject** object is a member of the **[Subprojects](15688529-6d9c-6429-0d22-a5a16c033dcc.md)** collection.
 **Using the Subproject Object**
Use  **Subprojects** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the subproject index or project summary task name, to return a single **Subproject** object. The following example prevents changes made to the specified subproject in a master project from being automatically made to the source project.
 **Using the Subprojects Collection**
Use the  **[Subprojects](e4b143fb-3da7-69bd-6535-5604c2cc2dc0.md)** property to return a **Subprojects** collection. The following example cautions the user if any of the subprojects in the active project are not on the hard disk.
