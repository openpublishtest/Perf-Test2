# ResourceGroups Object (Project)



Represents all of the resource-based group definitions.  **ResourceGroups** is a collection of **[Group](e3756818-f051-1ae4-5402-0398e568ebfc.md)** objects.
 **Using the ResourceGroups Collection**
Use the  **[ResourceGroups](9f268036-e676-708c-7688-b08cfa1ed5e1.md)** property to return a **ResourceGroups** collection. The following example lists the names of all the resource groups in the active project.



```
Dim rg As Group 
Dim rGroups As String 
 
For Each rg in ActiveProject.ResourceGroups 
 rGroups = rGroups &amp; rg.Name &amp; vbCrLf 
Next rg 
 
MsgBox rGroups
```

Use the  **[Add](cf29b43d-9746-ed87-8717-6f46fdd2319b.md)** method to add a **Group** object to the **ResourceGroups** collection. The following example creates a new group that groups resources by their standard rate and then modifies the criterion so that the resources are sorted in descending order.



```
ActiveProject.ResourceGroups.Add "Resources by Rate", "Standard Rate" 
ActiveProject.ResourceGroups("Resources by Rate").GroupCriteria(1).Ascending = False
```


## Remarks

For resource groups where the group hierarchy can be maintained and cell color can be a hexadecimal value, use the  **[ResourceGroups2](b1328c39-42bc-4e9b-e268-1f308cd7ebb1.md)** collection object.
