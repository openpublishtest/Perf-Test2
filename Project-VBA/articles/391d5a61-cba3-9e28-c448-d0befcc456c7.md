# Application.AutoFilter Method (Project)

Activates or deactivates the AutoFilter feature for the active project.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AutoFilter**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


### Return Value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

The  **AutoFilter** method toggles the AutoFilter feature on and off. It has the same effect as the **AutoFilter** command on the filter drop-down menu on the **View** tab for **Gantt Chart Tools** in the Ribbon. If column headings show the AutoFilter drop-down menu, executing the AutoFilter method hides the AutoFilter menus for columns in all sheet views in the active project.

To set an AutoFilter, see the  **[SetAutoFilter](4e4b4d4a-838b-f9b7-e3ab-d7bfa8efce5f.md)** method.
