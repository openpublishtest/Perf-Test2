# StartDriver.Suggestions Property (Project)

Gets a combination of  **[PjTaskWarnings](02bff43f-4459-3c34-5e8f-c441ffefe954.md)** values that indicate whether there are potential problems that should be fixed for a specified task. Read-only **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Suggestions**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **StartDriver** object.


## Remarks

If there are no suggestions for a task, the value of  **Suggestions** is 0. Because the value of **pjTaskWarningsResourceBeyondMaxUnit** is 64 and the value of **pjTaskWarningsResourceOverallocated** is 128, if **Suggestions** is 192, the task has both of the potential problems.


 **Note**  The  **PjTaskWarnings** enumeration can be used with both the **Suggestions** property and the **[Warnings](409c84e2-8307-fb82-af19-fa0e9f6b406b.md)** property.


## Example

In the following example, if the value of the  **Suggestions** property for task 2 is 128, the message box shows **The resource is overallocated**. If the value is 68, the message box shows:


-  **The assignment is more than the maximum resource units available.**
    
-  **The shadow task finishes earlier because of a predecessor link.**
    





```
Sub GetTaskSuggestions() 

 Dim suggestions As Long 

 Dim suggestionMsg As String 

 

 suggestions = ActiveProject.Tasks(2).StartDriver.Suggestions 

 

 suggestionMsg = CheckSuggestions(suggestions) 

 

 If Not suggestionMsg = "" Then MsgBox suggestionMsg 

End Sub 

 

Function CheckSuggestions(suggestions As Long) As String 

 Dim partial As Long 

 Dim suggestionResult As String 

 

 suggestionResult = "" 

 partial = suggestions Xor pjTaskWarningResourceBeyondMaxUnit 

 If partial < suggestions Then _ 

 suggestionResult = suggestionResult &amp; "The assignment is more than the maximum resource units available." &amp; vbCrLf 

 

 partial = suggestions Xor pjTaskWarningResourceOverallocated 

 If partial < suggestions Then _ 

 suggestionResult = suggestionResult &amp; "The resource is overallocated." &amp; vbCrLf 

 

 partial = suggestions Xor pjTaskWarningShadowFinishesEarlierDueToLink 

 If partial < suggestions Then _ 

 suggestionResult = suggestionResult &amp; "The shadow task finishes earlier because of a predecessor link." &amp; vbCrLf 

 

 CheckSuggestions = suggestionResult 

End Function
```
