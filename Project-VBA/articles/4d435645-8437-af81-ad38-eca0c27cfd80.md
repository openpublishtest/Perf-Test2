```
 
 Sub EnumerateSuccessors() 
 Dim Task As Task 
 Dim SuccTasks As Tasks 
 Dim ID As Long 
 Dim Successors As String 
 Dim List As String 
 Dim Count As Integer 
 
 ID = CLng(InputBox$("Enter the ID number of the task you wish to examine:")) 
 
 Set Task = ActiveProject.Tasks(ID) 
 Set SuccTasks = Task.SuccessorTasks 
 Successors = Task.WBSSuccessors 
 Count = 1 
 
 If SuccTasks.Count = 0 Then 
 List = "Task " &amp; Task.UniqueID &amp; ", " &amp; Task.Name &amp; ", has no successors." 
 Else 
 List = "Successors to task " &amp; Task.UniqueID &amp; ", " &amp; Task.Name &amp; ":" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf 
 Do While InStr(Successors, ListSeparator) <> 0 
 List = List &amp; SuccTasks(Count).Name &amp; ": " &amp; Mid$(Successors, 1, InStr(Successors, ListSeparator) - 1) &amp; vbCrLf 
 Successors = Right$(Successors, Len(Successors) - InStr(Successors, ListSeparator)) 
 Count = Count + 1 
 Loop 
 List = List &amp; SuccTasks(Count).Name &amp; ": " &amp; Successors 
 End If 
 
 MsgBox List 
 
 Set SuccTasks = Nothing 
 Set Task = Nothing
