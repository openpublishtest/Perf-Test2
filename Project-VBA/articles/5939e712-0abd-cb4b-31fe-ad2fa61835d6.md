## Example

The following example finds assignments where the resource is overallocated. When the overPeak argument is  **False**, the overallocation is not greater than the maximum resource time available (100%). If you set overPeak to **True**, the example finds overallocated assignments that exceed maximum resource time available, such as 150%.


```
Sub FindOverallocatedAssignments() 

 Dim t As Task 

 Dim a As Assignment 

 Dim overAlloc As OverAllocatedAssignments 

 Dim numOver As Long 

 Dim i As Long 

 Dim overPeak As Boolean 

 

 overPeak = True 

 

 For Each t In ActiveProject.Tasks 

 If t.Overallocated Then 

 Set overAlloc = t.StartDriver.OverAllocatedAssignments(overPeak) 

 numOver = overAlloc.Count 

 totalNumOver = overAlloc.TotalDetectedCount 

 

 For i = 1 To numOver 

 Set a = overAlloc.Item(i) 

 Debug.Print "Task: " &amp; t.Name &amp; " - Overallocated resource: " _ 

 &amp; a.ResourceName 

 Debug.Print vbTab &amp; "Resource peak: " &amp; a.Peak 

 Next i 

 End If 

 Next t 

End Sub
```
