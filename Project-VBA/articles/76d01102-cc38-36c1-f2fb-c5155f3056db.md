# TaskGroups Object (Project)

Represents all the task-based group definitions.  **TaskGroups** is a collection of **[Group](e3756818-f051-1ae4-5402-0398e568ebfc.md)** objects.


## Remarks

For task groups where the group hierarchy can be maintained and cell color can be a hexadecimal value, use the  **[TaskGroups2](08346fd5-3dbd-23ea-9dc8-c2361ce043f4.md)** collection object.


## Example

 **Using the TaskGroups Collection**

Use the  **[TaskGroups](fca3e169-396b-714d-8710-f54d8f777aeb.md)** property to return a **TaskGroups** collection. The following example lists the names of all the task groups in the active project.




```
Dim tg As Group 
Dim tGroups As String 
 
For Each tg in ActiveProject.TaskGroups 
 tGroups = tGroups &amp; tg.Name &amp; vbCrLf 
Next tg 
 
MsgBox tGroups
```

Use the  **[Add](e64d55db-6adc-5a6f-5b60-cd99bc1ab82a.md)** method to add a **Group** object to the **TaskGroups** collection. The following example creates a new group that groups tasks by whether they are overallocated and then modifies the criterion so that overallocated tasks are sorted in descending order.




```
ActiveProject.TaskGroups.Add "Overallocated Tasks", "Overallocated" 
ActiveProject.TaskGroups("Overallocated Tasks").GroupCriteria(1).Ascending = False
```
