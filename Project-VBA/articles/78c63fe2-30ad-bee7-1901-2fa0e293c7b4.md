# Project.CodeName Property (Project)

Gets the code name for the project. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **CodeName**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Project** object.


## Remarks

The code name is the name of the module that stores event macros (and other macros you may have defined) for a project. The default name for the module is "ThisProject"; you can view it in the  **Project** window in the Visual Basic Editor.

Changing the project name doesn't change the code name, and changing the code name (using the  **Properties** window in the Visual Basic Editor) doesn't change the project name.
