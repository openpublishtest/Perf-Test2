# PayRates Object (Project)

Contains a collection of  **[PayRate](4c8ba1f3-bf18-2179-5f50-c090c63e46b9.md)** objects.


## Example

 **Using the PayRate Object**

Use  **PayRates** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the pay rate index number or date for which to return the rates in effect, to return a single **PayRate** object. The following example returns the standard pay rate for Tamara's first row of rates in cost rate table C.




```
ActiveProject.Resources("Tamara").CostRateTables("C").PayRates(1).StandardRate
```

 **Using the PayRates Collection**

Use the  **[PayRates](260d9e77-9fce-5169-687f-027995c73273.md)** property to return a **PayRates** collection. The following example lists the standard pay rates for all the cost rate tables of the resource in the active cell.




```
Dim CRT As CostRateTable
DIM PR As PayRate
Dim Rates As String

For Each CRT In ActiveCell.Resource.CostRateTables
    For Each PR In CRT.PayRates
        Rates = Rates &amp; "CostRateTable " &amp; CRT.Name &amp; ": " &amp; PR.StandardRate &amp; vbCrLf
    Next PR
Next CRT
    
MsgBox Rates
```

Use the  **[Add](ba5d2667-7452-f9d9-032e-bb7c9d1d4911.md)** method to add a **PayRate** object to the **PayRates** collection. The following example adds a line to Tamara's cost rate table "C" with an effective date of September 1, 2012, a standard rate of $40.00 per hour, an overtime rate of $60.00 per hour, and a per-use cost of $0.




```
ActiveProject.Resources("Tamara").CostRateTables("C").PayRates.Add "9/1/2012", "$40/h", "$60/h", "$0"
```
