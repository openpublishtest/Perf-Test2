# Application.TogglePreventResOveralloc Method (Project)

Toggles the  **Prevent Overallocations** command for the Team Planner view.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **TogglePreventResOveralloc**

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **Application** object.


### Return Value

 **Boolean**


## Remarks

When the  **Prevent Overallocations** command is active, Project automatically moves tasks so that resources do not become overallocated because of changes made in the Team Planner view. Overallocations that exist when the **Prevent Overallocations** command is made active are also resolved.

The  **TogglePreventResOveralloc** method corresponds to the **Prevent Overallocations** command on the **Format** tab under **Team Planner Tools** on the ribbon.
