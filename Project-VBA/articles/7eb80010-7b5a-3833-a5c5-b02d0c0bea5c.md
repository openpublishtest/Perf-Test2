# SplitPart Object (Project)

Represents a task portion. The  **SplitPart** object is a member of the **[SplitParts](bc36310c-9289-a363-f2d6-c8a0991725e5.md)** collection.


## Examples

 **Using the SplitPart Object**

Use  **SplitParts** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the index number of the task portion, to return a single **SplitPart** object. The following example lists the start and finish times of each task portion of the task in the active cell.




```
Dim Part As Long, Portions As String

For Part = 1 To ActiveCell.Task.SplitParts.Count
    With ActiveCell.Task
        Portions = Portions &amp; "Task portion " &amp; Part &amp; ": Start on " &amp; _
            .SplitParts(Part).Start &amp; ", Finish on " &amp; _
            .SplitParts(Part).Finish &amp; vbCrLf
    End With
Next Part

MsgBox Portions
```

 **Using the SplitParts Collection**

Use the  **[SplitParts](e4c62dce-4ee0-aff3-3248-f6b5b04b0c2d.md)** property to return a **SplitParts** collection. The following example returns the number of task portions for each task in the active project.




```
Dim T As Task

For Each T In ActiveProject.Tasks
    If Not (T Is Nothing) Then
        MsgBox T.Name &amp; ": " &amp; T.SplitParts.Count
    End If

Next T
```

Use the  **[Split](847c5cfd-a10f-ea6a-aa49-2e2e88d1840e.md)** method ( **Task** object) to add a **SplitPart** object to the **SplitParts** collection. (The **Split** method creates a split in a task.) The following example creates a split in the task from Wednesday to Monday, in October of 2012.




```
ActiveCell.Task.Split "10/3/2012", "10/8/2012"
```
