# Chart Object (Project)
The  **Chart** object represents a chart on a report in Project.




## Remarks

The  **Chart** object in Project includes the standard members that other Office applications implement for Office Art. For example, see the **Chart** object in the VBA object model for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

In Project, a chart is represented by a  **Chart** object, which is contained by a **[Shape](d2b32bcd-5595-a4a7-9772-feb25fd0103a.md)** object or a **[ShapeRange](315031aa-4b8c-424b-26e7-ce15897beb05.md)** collection in a **[Report](38ef993e-e5cd-b451-06aa-41eb0e93450e.md)** object. For a diagram that shows the **Chart** object in the Project object model hierarchy, see[Application and Projects object map](608f1291-ce25-8a5f-f0ba-7c1e823a12f4.md).


 **Note**  Macro recording for the  **Chart** object is not implemented. That is, when you record a macro in Project and manually add a chart, add chart elements, or manually format a chart in a report, the steps for adding and manipulating the chart are not recorded.

You can use the  **[Shapes.AddChart](d404a9de-c1aa-c2a0-bf85-dc1f1735cf3c.md)** method to add a chart to a report. To determine whether a **Shape** or a **ShapeRange** contains a chart, use the **HasChart** method.

The  **Chart** object in Project does not implement events. So, a chart in Project cannot be animated to interact with mouse events or respond to events such as **Select** or **Calculate**, as it can in Excel.


## Example

The following example creates a simple scalar chart for tasks in the active project. The chart shows the  **Actual Work**,  **Remaining Work**, and  **Work** default fields.

To create some sample data, add four tasks to a new project, assign local resources to those tasks, and set various values of duration and actual work. For example, try the values in Table 1.


**Table 1. Sample data for a simple chart**


|**Task name**|**Duration**|**Actual work**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|T1|2d|16|
|T2|5d|19|
|T3|4d|7|
|T4|2d|0|
?




```
Sub AddSimpleScalarChart()
    Dim chartReport As Report
    Dim reportName As String
    
    ' Add a report.
    reportName = "Simple scalar chart"
    Set chartReport = ActiveProject.Reports.Add(reportName)

    ' Add a chart.
    Dim chartShape As Shape
    Set chartShape = ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Shapes.AddChart()
    
    chartShape.Chart.SetElement (msoElementChartTitleCenteredOverlay)
    chartShape.Chart.ChartTitle.Text = "Sample Chart for the Test1 project"
End Sub
```

When you run the  **AddSimpleScalarChart** macro, Project creates the report and adds a chart. The chart has default features, except the title is specified by the **SetElement** property to be overlaid on the chart, instead of the default position above the chart.

![Simple scalar chart in a report](images/pj15_VBA_ChartObject.gif)To delete the chart, you can delete the shape that contains the chart. The following macro deletes the chart on the report that is created by the  **AddSimpleScalarChart** macro, and leaves the empty report as the active view.




```
Sub DeleteTheShape()
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim reportName As String
    Dim theShape As MSProject.Shape
    
    reportName = "Simple scalar chart"
        
    For i = 1 To ActiveProject.Reports.Count
        If ActiveProject.Reports(i).Name = reportName Then
            Set theShape = ActiveProject.Reports(i).Shapes(1)
            theShape.Delete
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

To delete the report, go to a different view, and then open the  **Organizer** dialog box. You cannot delete a report while the report is active. The **Organizer** is available on the **DEVELOPER** tab of the ribbon, and also on the **DESIGN** tab, in the **Report** group, on the **Manage** menu. On the **Reports** tab of the **Organizer** dialog box, select **Simple scalar chart** in the project pane, and then choose **Delete**. Alternately, run the following macro to delete the report.




```
Sub DeleteTheReport()
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim reportName As String
    
    reportName = "Simple scalar chart"

    ' To delete the active report, change to another view.
    ViewApplyEx Name:="&amp;Gantt Chart"
    
    ActiveProject.Reports(reportName).Delete
End Sub
```
