# Assignments Object (Project)

Contains a collection of  **[Assignment](bfb9a505-7818-0a86-9d4b-f19a0ff465d3.md)** objects for a task or resource.


## Example

 **Using the Assignment Object**

Use  **Assignments(** _Index_ **)**, where _Index_ is the assignment index number, to return a single **Assignment** object. The following example displays the name of the first resource assigned to the specified task.




```
MsgBox ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments(1).ResourceName
```

 **Using the Assignments Collection**

Use the  **[Assignments](a481e813-8f02-c58b-2910-6995aaaafa09.md)** property to return an **Assignments** collection. The following example displays all the resources assigned to the specified task.




```
Dim A As Assignment 

 

For Each A In ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments 

 MsgBox A.ResourceName 

Next A
```

Use the  **[Add](c135a80e-1fb9-32e3-864e-f701c1947ca4.md)** method to add an **Assignment** object to the **Assignments** collection. The following example adds a resource identified by the number 212 as a new assignment for the specified task.




```
ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments.Add ResourceID:=212
```
