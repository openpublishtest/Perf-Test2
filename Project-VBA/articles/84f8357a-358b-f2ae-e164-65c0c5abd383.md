# Resources Object (Project)

Contains a collection of  **[Resource](eb83ed2f-2415-3f5d-3856-f4451a73a128.md)** objects.


## Example

 **Using the Resources Collection**

Use  **Resources** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the resource index number or resource name, to return a single **Resource** object. The following example lists the names of all resources in the active project.




```
Dim R As Long, Names As String 

 

For R = 1 To ActiveProject.Resources.Count 

 Names = ActiveProject.Resources(R).Name &amp; ", " &amp; Names 

Next R 

 

Names = Left$(Names, Len(Names) - Len(ListSeparator &amp; " ")) 

MsgBox Names
```

 **Using the Resources Collection**

Use the  **[Resources](40744aba-2b61-2b45-133a-f1dd9c7d6add.md)** property to return a **Resources** collection. The following example generates the same list as the previous example, but does so by setting an object reference to `ActiveProject.Resources` , and then using `R` where `ActiveProject.Resources` is used.




```
Dim R As Resources, Temp As Long, Names As String 

 

Set R = ActiveProject.Resources 

 

For Temp = 1 To R.Count 

 Names = R(Temp).Name &amp; ", " &amp; Names 

Next Temp 

 

Names = Left$(Names, Len(Names) - Len(ListSeparator &amp; " ")) 

MsgBox Names
```

Use the  **[Add](4fb69f50-4ba6-89a4-f586-3df268ae7fd5.md)** method to add a **Resource** object to the **Resources** collection. The following example adds a new resource named Matilda to the active project.




```
ActiveProject.Resources.Add "Matilda"
```
