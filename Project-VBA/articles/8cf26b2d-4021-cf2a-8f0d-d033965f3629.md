# Application.SelectTable Method (Project)
Selects the entire table, when one or more items within a table shape are selected in a report.

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SelectTable**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


### Return value

 **Boolean**

 **True** if the table is selected; otherwise, **False**.


## Remarks

When one or more items within a table shape are selected, the  **SelectTable** method removes the selection highlighting of the item(s), and selects the entire table.

If the active view is not a report, the  **SelectTable** method displays a dialog box with run-time error 1100, "The method is not available in this situation." If no item in a report is selected, or if an item in another kind of shape (not a table) is selected, Project shows run-time error -2147417848, "Automation error. The object invoked has disconnected from its clients."
