# EventInfo Object (Project)

Represents cancellation information for an event.


## Remarks

The  **EventInfo** object has one **Boolean** property, named **Cancel**. Project uses the **EventInfo** object instead of the _Cancel_ parameter that is used for events in some previous versions of Project.


## Example

The following event handler examines new resource assignments and cancels them if they are for the specified resource.


```
Private Sub App_ProjectBeforeAssignmentChange2(ByVal asg As Assignment, ByVal Field As PjAssignmentField, _ 
    ByVal NewVal As Variant, EventInfo As Object) 
 
    If Field = pjAssignmentResourceName And NewVal = "Lisa Jones" Then 
        MsgBox "Lisa is no longer available for assignment!" 
        EventInfo.Cancel = True 
    End If 
End Sub
```
