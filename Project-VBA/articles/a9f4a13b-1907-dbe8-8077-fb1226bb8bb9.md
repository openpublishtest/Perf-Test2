# Reports Object (Project)
Contains a collection of  **[Report](38ef993e-e5cd-b451-06aa-41eb0e93450e.md)** objects, where each report is a custom report.

## Example

The  **Reports** object is the collection of custom reports in a project. It does not include the built-in reports, such as **Project Overview**,  **Critical Tasks**, or  **Milestone Report**. Use the  **Project.Reports** property to get the **Reports** collection object, as in the following example:


```
Sub ListCustomReports()
    Dim oReport As Report
    Dim msg As String
    Dim msgBoxTitle As String
    msg = ""
    msgBoxTitle = "Custom reports in '" &amp; ActiveProject.Name &amp; "'"
    
    For Each oReport In ActiveProject.Reports
        msg = msg &amp; oReport.Index &amp; ": " &amp; oReport.Name &amp; vbCrLf
    Next oReport
        
    If ActiveProject.Reports.Count > 0 Then
        MsgBox Prompt:=msg, Title:=msgBoxTitle
    Else
        MsgBox Prompt:="This project contains no custom reports.", _
            Title:=msgBoxTitle
    End If
End Sub
```
