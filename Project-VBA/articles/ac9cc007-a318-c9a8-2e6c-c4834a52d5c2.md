# Days Object (Project)

Contains a collection of  **[Day](411fe04f-b68d-08c2-8b6c-f2c1e9927a34.md)** objects.


## Example

 **Using the Days Collection Object**

Use  **Days(** _Index_ **)**, where _Index_ is the day index number or **[PjWeekday](02572463-5e6d-e62e-6776-2e24359980aa.md)** constant, to return a single **Day** object. The following example counts the number of working days in the month of September 2002 for each selected resource.




```
Dim R As Resource, D As Integer, WorkingDays As Integer 

 

For Each R In ActiveSelection.Resources() 

 WorkingDays = 0 

 With R.Calendar.Years(2002).Months(pjSeptember) 

 For D = 1 To .Days.Count 

 If .Days(D).Working = True Then 

 WorkingDays = WorkingDays + 1 

 End If 

 Next D 

 End With 

 MsgBox "There are " &amp; WorkingDays &amp; " working days in " _ 

 &amp; R.Name &amp; "'s calendar." 

Next R
```

 **Getting the Days Collection Object.**

Use the  **[Days](86572272-1a5f-2c86-2111-e41f39f4c1e6.md)** property to return a **Days** collection. The following example counts the number of days in the month of September 2002.




```
MsgBox ActiveProject.Calendar.Years(2006).Months(pjNovember).Days.Count 


```
