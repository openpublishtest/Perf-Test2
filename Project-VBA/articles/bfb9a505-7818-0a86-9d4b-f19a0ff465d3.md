# Assignment Object (Project)

Represents an assignment for a task or resource. The  **Assignment** object is a member of an **[Assignments](83661095-030c-0488-5763-320b6de6f381.md)** or an **[OverAllocatedAssignments](b2856ebf-cff2-04a6-53c9-123de09f2a3b.md)** collection.


## Example

 **Using the Assignment Object**

Use  **Assignments** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the assignment index number, to return a single **Assignment** object. The following example displays the name of the first resource assigned to the specified task.




```
MsgBox ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments(1).ResourceName
```

 **Using the Assignments Collection**

Use the  **[Assignments](a481e813-8f02-c58b-2910-6995aaaafa09.md)** property to return an **Assignments** collection. The following example displays all the resources assigned to the specified task.




```
Dim A As Assignment 
 
For Each A In ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments 
 MsgBox A.ResourceName 
Next A
```

Use the  **[Add](c135a80e-1fb9-32e3-864e-f701c1947ca4.md)** method to add an **Assignment** object to the **Assignments** collection. The following example adds a resource identified by the number 212 as a new assignment for the specified task.




```
ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments.Add ResourceID:=212
```
