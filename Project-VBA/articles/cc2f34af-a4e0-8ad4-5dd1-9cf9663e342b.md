 _expression_ An expression that returns an **Application** object.

## Remarks

The  **TaskInspector** method corresponds to the **Inspect Task** drop-down menu item on the **TASK** ribbon. The **TaskInspector** method has the same effect as the **[TaskDrivers](5c5e7563-e994-809b-7a9c-34f6ea338241.md)** method.

The  **Task Inspector** pane includes factors that affect the task start date and finish date (task drivers such as calendars and predecessor tasks) and can also show warnings, suggestions, and ignored problems.
