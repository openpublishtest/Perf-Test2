# Shift.Index Property (Project)

Gets the index of a  **Shift** object in the containing object. Read-only **Integer**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Index**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Shift** object.


## Remarks

Following are the objects that can contain  **Shift** objects:


-  **Day**
    
-  **Month**
    
-  **WeekDay**
    
-  **WorkWeekDay**
    
-  **Year**
    


 **Shift** objects are accessed using the **Shift1**... **Shift5** properties. Because Project defines five shifts, the **Index** property can have only the values 1 through 5.

The  **Index** properties of different objects are used in similar ways. For an example, see the **[Index](1213f55b-aca0-76ee-2e8a-2442a2c576e1.md)** property of the **Project** object.


## Example

The following command in the  **Immediate** window of the VBE prints the value 2.


```
? activeproject.Calendar.WeekDays.Item(3).Shift2.Index
```
