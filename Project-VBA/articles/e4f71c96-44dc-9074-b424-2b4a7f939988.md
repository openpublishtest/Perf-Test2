# Task.WBSPredecessors Property (Project)

Gets the work breakdown structure (WBS) codes of the task predecessors, separated by the list separator. Read-only  **String**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **WBSPredecessors**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Task** object.


## Example

The following example queries the user for a task ID and then provides a more user-friendly breakdown of its predecessors' WBS codes.


```
Sub EnumeratePredecessors() 
 Dim Task As Task 
 Dim PredTasks As Tasks 
 Dim ID As Long 
 Dim Predecessors As String 
 Dim List As String 
 Dim Count As Integer 
 
 ID = CLng(InputBox$("Enter the ID number of the task you wish to examine:")) 
 
 Set Task = ActiveProject.Tasks(ID) 
 Set PredTasks = Task.PredecessorTasks 
 Predecessors = Task.WBSPredecessors 
 Count = 1 
 
 If PredTasks.Count = 0 Then 
 List = "Task " &amp; Task.UniqueID &amp; ", " &amp; Task.Name &amp; ", has no predecessors." 
 Else 
 List = "Predecessors to task " &amp; Task.UniqueID &amp; ", " &amp; Task.Name &amp; ":" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf 
 Do While InStr(Predecessors, ListSeparator) <> 0 
 List = List &amp; PredTasks(Count).Name &amp; ": " &amp; Mid$(Predecessors, 1, InStr(Predecessors, ListSeparator) - 1) &amp; vbCrLf 
 Predecessors = Right$(Predecessors, Len(Predecessors) - InStr(Predecessors, ListSeparator)) 
 Count = Count + 1 
 Loop 
 List = List &amp; PredTasks(Count).Name &amp; ": " &amp; Predecessors 
 End If 
 
 MsgBox List 
 
 Set PredTasks = Nothing 
 Set Task = Nothing 
End Sub
