```vb
Dim pgLoop As Page 
Dim shpLoop As Shape 
 
For Each pgLoop In ActiveDocument.Pages 
 For Each shpLoop In pgLoop.Shapes 
 If shpLoop.Type = pbLinkedPicture Then 
 
 With shpLoop.PictureFormat 
 
 Debug.Print "File Name: " &amp; .Filename 
 Debug.Print "Resolution in Publication: " &amp; .EffectiveResolution &amp; " dpi" 
 Debug.Print "Original Resolution: " &amp; .OriginalResolution &amp; " dpi" 
 
 End With
