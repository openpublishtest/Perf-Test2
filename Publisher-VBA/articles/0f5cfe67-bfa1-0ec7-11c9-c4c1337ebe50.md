# Using Events with the Document Object (Publisher)

The  **Document** object supports seven events: **[BeforeClose](d40e36b6-fea7-a9d5-0c88-55197983b888.md)**,  **[Open](43108d1d-d101-8a07-943e-c9b8dbadcbfd.md)**,  **[Redo](c00db13d-1c03-2536-8923-bd7d9393fee2.md)**,  **[ShapesAdded](f6573f7c-56fa-1efa-9dba-39cde3859cc0.md)**,  **[ShapesRemoved](e2a67359-5673-2c72-e1fc-e3e3a3b564f9.md)**,  **[Undo](9789e469-dc84-a0b7-ffe0-405d4e7ad861.md)**, and  **[WizardAfterChange](c4ec0950-3a58-1f29-b35f-35db9d87f330.md)**. You write procedures to respond to these events in the class module named "ThisDocument". Use the following steps to create an event procedure.


1. Under your publication project in the  **Project Explorer** window, double-click **ThisDocument**. (In  **Folder** view, **ThisDocument** is located in the **Microsoft Publisher Objects** folder.)
    
2. Select  **Document** from the **Object** drop-down list box.
    
3. Select an event from the  **Procedure** drop-down list box. An empty subroutine is added to the class module.
    
4. Add the Visual Basic instructions you want to run when the event occurs.
    

## Example

This example shows an  **Open** event procedure that displays a message when a publication is opened.


```vb
Private Sub Document_Open() 
    MsgBox "This publication is copyrighted." 
End Sub
```

The following example shows a  **BeforeClose** event procedure that prompts the user for a yes or no response before closing a document.




```vb
Private Sub Document_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean) 
    Dim intResponse As Integer 
 
    intResponse = MsgBox("Do you really want to close " _ 
        &amp; "the document?", vbYesNo) 
 
    If intResponse = vbNo Then Cancel = True 
End Sub
```
