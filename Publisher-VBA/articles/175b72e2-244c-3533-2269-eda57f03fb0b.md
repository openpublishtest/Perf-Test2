# ShapeNode Members (Publisher)
Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform. Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The  **ShapeNode** object is a member of the **[ShapeNodes](f190a8a8-e03a-e8a2-482a-5e092ff3ed86.md)** collection. The  **ShapeNodes** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.

## Properties



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| [Application](8bb74320-d748-b308-00b3-fbc8b52ef032.md)|Used without an object qualifier, this property returns an  **[Application](acfc7efb-e6a5-a89a-3aee-3cb4af2f3508.md)** object that represents the current instance of Publisher. Used with an object qualifier, this property returns an  **Application** object that represents the creator of the specified object. When used with an OLE Automation object, it returns the object's application.|
| [EditingType](f01db634-b35a-48cd-851d-418848674686.md)|If the specified node is a vertex, this property returns an  **MsoEditingType** constant indicating how changes made to the node affect the two segments connected to the node. If the node is a control point for a curved segment, this property returns the editing type of the adjacent vertex. Read-only.|
| [Parent](1626a200-8608-70fe-19be-89056eafc256.md)|Returns an object that represents the parent object of the specified object. For example, for a  **[TextFrame](95e88f5a-b3dc-272e-7c1d-5282c97ae11e.md)** object, returns a **[Shape](666cb7f0-62a8-f419-9838-007ef29506ee.md)** object representing the parent shape of the text frame. Read-only.|
| [Points](30235d5a-9f05-4cc4-f62f-ac3cf4916e0d.md)|Gets the  _x-_ and _y-_ coordinates of the shape node. Read-only.|
| [SegmentType](471206b2-ca37-5e4a-678b-df8a47c90f96.md)|Returns an  **MsoSegmentType** constant that indicates whether the segment associated with the specified node is straight or curved. Read-only.|
