# Font.Ligature Property (Publisher)

Returns or sets a  **[pbLigaturePresetType](cab28185-8c1f-40cd-9f56-daabf51ab2e7.md)** constant that represents the state of the **Ligature** property on the characters in a text range. The **Ligature** property enables embellishments to the characters, often in the form of bigger and more flamboyant serifs. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Ligature**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **[Font](992fda94-2820-d665-0d78-efd4b5434731.md)** object.


## Return Value

 **pbLigaturePresetType**


## Remarks


 **Note**  The  **Ligature** property has an effect only for OpenType fonts that contain ligatures.

Ligatures are alternate appearances of sequences of characters; multiple characters are merged into one glyph. For example, when ligatures are turned on for the word  _Office_, the letters  _ffi_ are all joined together into one glyph that displays a continuous line from the first _f_ through the dot in the _i_.
