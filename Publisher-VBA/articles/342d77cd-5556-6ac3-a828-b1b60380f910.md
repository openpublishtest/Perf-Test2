# Window Object (Publisher)

Represents a window. Many publication characteristics, such as scroll bars and rulers, are actually properties of the window.


## Example

Use the  **[ActiveWindow](125e2bb4-f922-ceef-9e3e-5dbe3aaff2a4.md)** property to return a **Window** object. The following example maximizes the active window.


```vb
Sub MaximizeWindow 
 ActiveWindow.WindowState = pbWindowStateMaximize 
End Sub
```

Use the  **[Caption](1dbf66c9-e964-b17f-684f-70cbbaa5fbc7.md)** property to return the file and application names of the active window. The following example displays a message with the file name and Microsoft Publisher application name.




```vb
Sub ShowFileApNames 
 MsgBox Windows(1).Caption 
End Sub
```
