# CalloutFormat.AutomaticLength Method (Publisher)

Specifies that the first segment of the callout line (the segment attached to the text callout box) be scaled automatically when the callout is moved.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AutomaticLength**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **CalloutFormat** object.


## Remarks

Calling this method sets the  **[AutoLength](ed874ec4-d4ce-5e3f-771a-8b3158f40707.md)** property of the specified object to **msoTrue**.

Use the  **[CustomLength](855df4af-a02f-fff3-9b12-af886a9788bc.md)** method to specify that the first segment of the callout line retain the fixed length returned by the **[Length](878fdb7b-fca6-49b6-1ec0-143243ce014c.md)** property whenever the callout is moved. Applies only to callouts whose lines consist of more than one segment (types **msoCalloutThree** and **msoCalloutFour**).


## Example

This example switches between an automatically-scaling first segment and one with a fixed length for the callout line for the first shape in the active publication. For the example to work, this shape must be a callout.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).Callout 
 If .AutoLength Then 
 .CustomLength Length:=50 
 Else 
 .AutomaticLength 
 End If 
End With 

```
