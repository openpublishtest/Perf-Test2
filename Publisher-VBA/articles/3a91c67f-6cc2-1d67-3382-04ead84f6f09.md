# MailMergeFilters Object (Publisher)

Represents all the filters to apply to the data source attached to the mail merge or catalog merge publication. The  **MailMergeFilters** object is composed of **MailMergeFilterCriterion** objects.


## Example

Use the  **[Add](ab114dda-d144-7c5f-88b0-930cadcf53db.md)** method of the  **MailMergeFilters** object to add a new filter criterion to the query. This example adds a new line to the query string and then applies the combined filter to the data source. This example assumes that a data source is attached to the active publication.


```vb
Sub FilterDataSource() 
 With ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource 
 .Filters.Add Column:="Region", _ 
 Comparison:=msoFilterComparisonIsBlank, _ 
 Conjunction:=msoFilterConjunctionAnd 
 .ApplyFilter 
 End With 
End Sub
```

Use the  **[Item](6da1766f-c497-0426-d413-4254a3dc2c8c.md)** method to access an individual filter criterion. This example loops through all the filter criterion and if it finds one with a value of "Region", changes it to remove from the mail merge all records that are not equal to "WA". This example assumes that a data source is attached to the active publication.




```vb
Sub SetQueryCriterion() 
 Dim intItem As Integer 
 With ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Filters 
 For intItem = 1 To .Count 
 With .Item(intItem) 
 If .Column = "Region" Then 
 .Comparison = msoFilterComparisonNotEqual 
 .CompareTo = "WA" 
 If .Conjunction = "Or" Then .Conjunction = "And" 
 End If 
 End With 
 Next 
 End With 
End Sub
```
