# Shape.MoveOutOfTextFlow Method (Publisher)

Moves a given inline shape out of its containing text range, defined by  ** [TextRange Object](566f240b-d2a6-8cb3-9eb7-68328d6c28bd.md)**, and makes the shape fixed.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **MoveOutOfTextFlow**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shape** object.


## Remarks

An automation error is returned if the shape to be moved is not already inline.

After the  **MoveOutOfTextFlow** method is called on an inline shape, the shape will maintain its position on the page, but it will no longer be inline.


## Example

The following example moves the first inline shape contained in a given text range out of the text flow.


```vb
Dim theShape As Shape 
 
Set theShape = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).Shapes(1) _ 
 .TextFrame.TextRange.InlineShapes(1) 
 
theShape.MoveOutOfTextFlow
```
