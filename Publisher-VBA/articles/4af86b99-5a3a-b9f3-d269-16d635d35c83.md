# Shapes.AddCatalogMergeArea Method (Publisher)

Adds a  **Shape** object that represents the specified publication's catalog merge area.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **AddCatalogMergeArea**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Shapes** object.


### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

Only one catalog merge area can be added to a publication page. Typically, a publication will only have one catalog merge area.

Although you can add one catalog merge area per publication page, you can only connect to a single data source for a publication. What data is merged is determined by the catalog merge area on the active page, and the data fields it contains.


 **Note**  You must add a catalog merge area to the publication page before you connect to a data source.
