# RulerGuide Object (Publisher)

Represents a gridline used to align objects on a page. The  **RulerGuide** object is a member of the **[RulerGuides](c58d3cb2-8cf8-74fa-2bf4-a931dc95a26a.md)** collection.


## Example

Use the  **[Add](3986452a-73da-04c2-4e11-8369d61cd974.md)** method of the  **RulerGuides** collection to create a new ruler gridline. Use the **[Item](e0c49279-4fd4-fe61-636c-c29399fdc404.md)** property to reference a ruler guide. Use the  **[Position](af169eaf-3cca-0310-c49b-369ba9b2193f.md)** property to change the position of a gridline, and use the  **[Delete](810f443c-30b9-7ac9-f4d5-349dda8a945c.md)** method to remove a gridline. This example creates a new ruler guide, moves it, and then deletes it.


```vb
Sub AddChangeDeleteGuide() 
 Dim rgLine As RulerGuide 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).RulerGuides 
 .Add Position:=InchesToPoints(1), _ 
 Type:=pbRulerGuideTypeVertical 
 
 MsgBox "The ruler guide position is at one inch." 
 
 .Item(1).Position = InchesToPoints(3) 
 MsgBox "The ruler guide is now at three inches." 
 
 .Item(1).Delete 
 MsgBox "The ruler guide has been deleted." 
 End With 
End Sub
```
