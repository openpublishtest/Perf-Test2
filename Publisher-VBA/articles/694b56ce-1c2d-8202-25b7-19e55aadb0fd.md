# WebPageOptions Object (Publisher)

Represents the properties of a single Web page within a Web publication, including options for adding the title and description of the page, background sounds, in addition to other options. The  **WebPageOptions** object is a member of the **[Page](9b2e8f29-26c3-1008-0ffd-eea2147abca4.md)** object.


## Remarks

Note that the  **WebPageOptions** object is only available when the active publication is a Web publication. A run-time error is returned if trying to access this object from a print publication.


## Example

Use the  **[WebPageOptions](c2e3ee01-5b49-e83c-a68b-a4d526da0215.md)** property on the **Page** object to return a **WebPageOptions** object. Use the **[Description](dfd18427-c70d-7232-191e-a6332a89c3fe.md)** property to set the description of a specified Web page. The following example sets the description for the second page of the active Web publication.


```vb
Dim theWPO As WebPageOptions 
 
Set theWPO = ActiveDocument.Pages(2).WebPageOptions 
 
With theWPO 
 .Description = "Company Profile" 
End With
```
