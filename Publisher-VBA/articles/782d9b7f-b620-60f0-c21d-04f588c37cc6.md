# Document.ScratchArea Property (Publisher)

## Syntax

 _expression_. **ScratchArea**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Document** object.

## Example

This example sets the variable object as the first shape on the scratch area of the active document.


```vb
Sub ScratchPad() 
 
 Dim saPage As ScratchArea 
 Dim objFirst As Object 
 
 saPage = Application.ActiveDocument.ScratchArea 
 objFirst = saPage.Shapes(1) 
 
End Sub
```
