# DropCap Object (Publisher)

Represents a dropped capital letter at the beginning of a paragraph.


## Example

Use the  **[DropCap](a5c29dd4-62f4-39fb-4b76-390d62bd8e32.md)** property to return a  **DropCap** object. The following example sets a dropped capital letter for the first letter of each paragraph in the first shape on the first page of the active publication. This example assumes that the specified shape is a text box and not another type of shape.


```vb
Sub ApplyDropCap() 
 ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange _ 
 .DropCap.ApplyCustomDropCap Size:=3, Span:=3, Bold:=True 
End Sub
```
