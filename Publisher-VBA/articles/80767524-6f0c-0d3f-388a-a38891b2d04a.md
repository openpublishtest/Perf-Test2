# PageSize Object (Publisher)

Represents the page size of the current Microsoft Publisher publication.


## Remarks

The page size represented by the  **PageSize** object corresponds to one of the icons displayed under **Blank Page Sizes** in the **Page Setup** dialog box in the Publisher user interface.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Name** property of the **PageSize** object to get a list of the names of all the page sizes available in the current document and print the list in the **Immediate** window.


```vb
Public Sub PageSizes_Example() 
 
 Dim pubPageSizes As Publisher.PageSizes 
 Dim pubPageSize As Publisher.PageSize 
 
 Set pubPageSizes = ThisDocument.PageSetup.AvailablePageSizes 
 For Each pubPageSize In pubPageSizes 
 Debug.Print pubPageSize.Name 
 Next 
 
End Sub
```
