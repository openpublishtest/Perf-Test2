# Document.Save Method (Publisher)

Saves the specified publication.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Save**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Document** object.


## Remarks

If the publication has not been previously saved, calling the  **Save** method is equivalent to calling the **[SaveAs](ba8b85d7-8ca9-dcf5-12b4-4cabced743e6.md)** method with the **_FileName_** argument set to the value of the publication's **[Name](1abbf9ab-f7b4-1119-68c8-5c49d74a45b3.md)** property. If the publication has been previously saved, the **Save** method saves the current version of the publication in the format in which it was opened and in the location to which it was last saved.

Calling the  **Save** method always performs saves in the foreground regardless of whether background saves are enabled.


## Example

This example saves the active publication if it has changed since it was last saved.


```vb
If ActiveDocument.Saved = False Then ActiveDocument.Save
```
