# InstalledPrinters Object (Publisher)

Represents the collection of all  **Printer** objects, each of which represents one of the printers installed on the computer.


## Remarks

To provide the user a choice of printers to print a publication, you can iterate through the  **InstalledPrinters** collection to get a list of the names of all the printers installed on the computer, as shown in the following example.

The default property of the  **InstalledPrinters** collection is **Item**.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how you can use the  **[PrinterName](6987b89b-a77e-03c5-bd7e-015510034550.md)** and **[IsActivePrinter](578fc5d4-2601-66db-cdec-657814756e29.md)** properties of the **Printer** object to get a list of all the installed printers on the computer and to determine which of them is currently the active printer.


```vb
Public Sub InstalledPrinters_Example() 
 
 Dim pubInstalledPrinters As Publisher.InstalledPrinters 
 Dim pubApplication As Publisher.Application 
 Dim pubPrinter As Publisher.Printer 
 
 Set pubApplication = ThisDocument.Application 
 Set pubInstalledPrinters = pubApplication.InstalledPrinters 
 
 For Each pubPrinter In pubInstalledPrinters 
 Debug.Print pubPrinter.PrinterName 
 If pubPrinter.IsActivePrinter Then 
 Debug.Print "This is the active printer." 
 End If 
 Next 
 
End Sub 

```
