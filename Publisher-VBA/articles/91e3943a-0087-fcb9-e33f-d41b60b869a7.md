# ThreeDFormat.ResetRotation Method (Publisher)

Resets the extrusion rotation around the x-axis (horizontal) and the y-axis (vertical) to 0 (zero) so that the front of the extrusion faces forward.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **ResetRotation**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ThreeDFormat** object.


## Remarks

This method doesn't reset the rotation around the z-axis (extends outward from the plane of the publication).

To set the extrusion rotation around the x-axis and the y-axis to anything other than 0, use the  **[RotationX](1ee394cb-746b-02f0-f2af-aa4a6fffd172.md)** and  **[RotationY](571f090b-71a8-c92e-b4d8-4f21a4c383ed.md)** properties of the  **ThreeDFormat** object.

To set the extrusion rotation around the z-axis, use the  **[Rotation](3cb55e8c-83fa-2f20-caac-a1e897e9a369.md)** property of the  **[Shape](666cb7f0-62a8-f419-9838-007ef29506ee.md)** object that represents the extruded shape.


## Example

This example resets the rotation around the x-axis and the y-axis to zero for the extrusion of the first shape in the active publication.


```
ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1).ThreeD _ 
 .ResetRotation
