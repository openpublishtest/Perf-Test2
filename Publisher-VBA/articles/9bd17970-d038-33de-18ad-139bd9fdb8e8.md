# Window.Activate Method (Publisher)

Activates a window or OLE object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Activate**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Window** object.


### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

Because Publisher runs in a single window, using the  **Activate** method with a **Window** object makes Publisher the active application.


## Example

The following example makes Publisher the active application.


```
Application.ActiveWindow.Activate
```

The following example adds an Excel spreadsheet to the first page of the active publication and activates the spreadsheet for editing.




```vb
Dim shpSheet As Shape 
 
Set shpSheet = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes.AddOLEObject _ 
 (Left:=72, Top:=72, ClassName:="Excel.Sheet") 
 
shpSheet.OLEFormat.Activate
```
