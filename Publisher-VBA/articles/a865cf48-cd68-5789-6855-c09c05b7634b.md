# View Object (Publisher)

Contains the view attributes (show all, field shading, table gridlines, and so on) for a window or pane.


## Example

Use the  **[ActiveView](1448c8c6-30e5-2e2a-f124-ebf544d8f297.md)** property to return the **View** object. The following example specifies the zoom setting.


```vb
Sub ZoomFitSelection() 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveView.Zoom = pbZoomFitSelection 
End Sub
```

The following examples zoom in and out, respectively, on the active view.




```vb
Sub ViewZoomIn() 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveView.ZoomIn 
End Sub 
 
Sub ViewZoomOut() 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveView.ZoomOut 
End Sub
```

The following example scrolls the active view to the specified shape.




```vb
Sub ScrollToShape() 
 Dim shpOne As Shape 
 
 Set shpOne = ActiveDocument.Pages(1).Shapes(1) 
 ActiveDocument.ActiveView.ScrollShapeIntoView Shape:=shpOne 
End Sub
```
