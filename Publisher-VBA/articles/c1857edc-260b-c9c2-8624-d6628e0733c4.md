```vb
Sub ExcludeRecords() 
 Dim intRecord As Integer 
 With ActiveDocument.MailMerge 
 For intRecord = 1 To .DataSource.RecordCount 
 .DataSource.ActiveRecord = intRecord 
 If Len(.DataSource.DataFields("PostalCode").Value) < 5 Then 
 With .DataSource 
 .Included = False 
 .InvalidAddress = True 
 .InvalidComments = "This record is removed " &amp; _ 
 "from the mail merge because its postal code" &amp; _ 
 "has less than five digits." 
 End With 
 End If 
 Next 
 End With 
End Sub
```
