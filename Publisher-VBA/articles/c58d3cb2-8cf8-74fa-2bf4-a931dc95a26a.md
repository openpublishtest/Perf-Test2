# RulerGuides Object (Publisher)

A collection of  **[RulerGuide](6400c368-02e9-169c-c675-9416cd361384.md)** objects that represents a gridline used to align objects on a page.


## Example

Use the  **[Add](3986452a-73da-04c2-4e11-8369d61cd974.md)** method of the  **RulerGuides** collection to add ruler gridlines to the **RulerGuides** collection. This example creates horizontal ruler guides and vertical ruler guides every half inch on the first page of the active publication.


```vb
Sub SetRulerGuides() 
 Dim intCount As Integer 
 Dim intPos As Integer 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).RulerGuides 
 For intCount = 1 To 16 
 intPos = intPos + 36 
 .Add Position:=intPos, Type:=pbRulerGuideTypeVertical 
 Next intCount 
 intPos = 0 
 For intCount = 1 To 21 
 intPos = intPos + 36 
 .Add Position:=intPos, Type:=pbRulerGuideTypeHorizontal 
 Next intCount 
 End With 
End Sub
```

Use the  **[Count](92a93b1a-80c1-7a41-cb94-ac0859a4a470.md)** property to return the total number of ruler guides, horizontal and vertical, in the collection. The following example uses the  **Count** property to create a loop that deletes each of the ruler guides in the collection.




```vb
Sub RemoveAllGuides() 
 Dim intCount As Integer 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1).RulerGuides 
 For intCount = 1 To .Count 
 .Item(1).Delete 
 Next intCount 
 End With 
End Sub
```
