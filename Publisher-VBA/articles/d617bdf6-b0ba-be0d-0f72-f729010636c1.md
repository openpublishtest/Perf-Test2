# Attachment Object (Publisher)

Represents an attachment to a merged e-mail message.


## Remarks

An **Attachment** object corresponds to one of the attachments in the list of attachments in the **Attachments** box in the **Merge to E-mail** dialog box in the Microsoft Publisher user interface. (On the **File** menu, point to **Send E-mail**, click  **Send E-mail Merge**, and then click  **Options**.)

To remove the attachment from the merged e-mail, use the  **Delete** method of the **Attachment** object.


## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Add** method to add an attachment to an e-mail merge message. It adds an **Attachment** object that represents a bitmap image to the **Attachments** collection of the active document.

Before running this macro, place a file named  _image.bmp_ in the root of the C drive on your computer, or change the name and file path of the file in the macro to specify the one you want to attach.

Note that to send an e-mail merge message, you must connect to a data source, create the e-mail merge, and then send the message. For more information, see the  **[EmailMergeEnvelope](555dd80e-bac2-96dd-4256-ad1b8006da0f.md)** object topic.




```vb
Public Sub Attachment_Example() 
 
 Dim pubAttachments As Publisher.Attachments 
 Dim pubAttachment As Publisher.Attachment 
 Dim pubMailMerge As Publisher.MailMerge 
 Dim pubEmailMergeEnvelope As Publisher.EmailMergeEnvelope 
 
 Set pubMailMerge = ThisDocument.MailMerge 
 Set pubEmailMergeEnvelope = pubMailMerge.EmailMergeEnvelope 
 Set pubAttachments = pubEmailMergeEnvelope.Attachemts 
 
 Set pubAttachment = pubAttachments.Add("C:\image.bmp") 
 
End Sub
```
