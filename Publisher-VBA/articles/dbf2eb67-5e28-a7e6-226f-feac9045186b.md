## Example

The following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to add an attachment to the message in an e-mail merge. The code adds an attachment to an e-mail message and then prints the number of current attachments to the message in the  **Immediate** window.

The attachment in this example is an image file at the root of the C drive. Before running the code, replace " _C:\image.jpg_" with the path to and name of the file on your computer that you want to add as an e-mail attachment.

Before you can create an e-mail merge, you must use the  **[OpenDataSource](4473e566-687f-595e-9fd6-a5483021cb48.md)** method of the **[MailMerge](028e1e42-c61c-9b2b-4aec-d6a184504ec1.md)** object to connect the active document to a data source. To run the merge, use the **[Execute](351a64ab-3c6c-c9c9-7ffe-b60b73d390ae.md)** method of the **MailMerge** object. For an example of how to connect to a data source and create an e-mail merge, see the **[EmailMergeEnvelope](555dd80e-bac2-96dd-4256-ad1b8006da0f.md)** object topic.




```vb

```
