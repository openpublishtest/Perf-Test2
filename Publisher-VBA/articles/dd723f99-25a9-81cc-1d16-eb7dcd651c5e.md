# GroupShapes Object (Publisher)

Represents the individual shapes within a grouped shape. Each shape is represented by a  **[Shape](666cb7f0-62a8-f419-9838-007ef29506ee.md)** object. Using the  **[Item](d0e2f8a6-6529-a274-410b-744c2bb55774.md)** method with this object, you can work with single shapes within a group without having to ungroup them.


## Example

Use the  **[GroupItems](9194f43b-bd8a-76a9-aa8c-17544d052d47.md)** property to return a  **GroupShapes** collection. Use **GroupItems**(index), where index is the number of the individual shape within the grouped shape, to return a single shape from the  **GroupShapes** collection. The following example adds three triangles to the active document, groups them, sets a color for the entire group, and then changes the color for the third triangle only.


```vb
Sub WorkWithGroupShapes() 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages.Add(Count:=1, After:=1).Shapes 
 .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, _ 
 50, 50, 100, 100).Name = "shpOne" 
 .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, _ 
 200, 50, 100, 100).Name = "shpTwo" 
 .AddShape(msoShapeIsoscelesTriangle, _ 
 350, 50, 100, 100).Name = "shpThree" 
 With .Range(Array("shpOne", "shpTwo", "shpThree")).Group 
 .Fill.PresetTextured PresetTexture:=msoTextureBlueTissuePaper 
 .GroupItems(3).Fill.PresetTextured _ 
 PresetTexture:=msoTextureGreenMarble 
 End With 
 End With 
End Sub
```
