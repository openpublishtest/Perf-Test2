# Tag Object (Publisher)

Represents a tag or a custom property that you can create for a shape, shape range, page, or publication. Each  **Tag** object contains the name of a custom property and a value for that property. **Tag** objects are members of the **[Tags](76cccc1e-4623-af8b-f0f8-e6cc245b94fd.md)** collection. Create a tag when you want to be able to selectively work with specific members of a collection, based on an attribute that isn't already represented by a built-in property.


## Example

Use the  **[Item](5f2dd7ef-6c7f-cae6-f866-3922fb422353.md)** method of the  **[Tags](76cccc1e-4623-af8b-f0f8-e6cc245b94fd.md)** collection to return a  **Tag** object. This example fills all shapes on the first page of the active publication if the shape's first tag has a value of Oval.


```vb
Sub FormatTaggedShapes() 
 Dim shp As Shape 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1) 
 For Each shp In .Shapes 
 If shp.Tags.Count > 0 Then 
 If shp.Tags.Item(1).Value = "Oval" Then 
 shp.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(Red:=255, Green:=0, Blue:=0) 
 End If 
 End If 
 Next 
 End With 
End Sub
```

Use the  **[Add](78602ccc-8198-1183-4775-fe626eb8b5af.md)** method to add a Tag object. This example adds a tag to all oval shapes in the active publication.




```vb
Sub TagShapes() 
 Dim shp As Shape 
 With ActiveDocument.Pages(1) 
 For Each shp In .Shapes 
 If InStr(1, shp.Name, "Oval") > 0 Then 
 shp.Tags.Add Name:="Oval", Value:="This is an oval shape." 
 End If 
 Next shp 
 End With 
End Sub
```
