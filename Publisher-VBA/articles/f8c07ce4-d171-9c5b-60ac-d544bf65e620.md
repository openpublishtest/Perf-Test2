# Application.PathSeparator Property (Publisher)

Returns a  **String** that represents the character used to separate folder names. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **PathSeparator**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Application** object.


### Return Value

String


## Remarks

You can use  **PathSeparator** to build Web addresses even though they contain forward slashes (/).

The  **[FullName](137e4310-8431-ed2a-503a-c225378a9a74.md)** property returns the path and file name as a single string.

For worldwide compatibility, we recommend that you use this property when building paths, rather than referring explicitly to path separator characters in code (for example, "/").


## Example

This example displays the path and file name of the active document.


```vb
Sub PathFileName() 
 
 With Application 
 MsgBox "The name of the active document: " &amp; vbLf &amp; _ 
 .Path &amp; .PathSeparator &amp; ActiveDocument.Name 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
