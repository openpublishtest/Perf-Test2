# VisConnectedShapesFlags Enumeration (Visio)

Specifies constants that identify shapes by the directionality of their connectors; passed to the  **[Shape.ConnectedShapes](7f5a0ac9-d0a7-d9fe-9ecb-8e8070ab5951.md)** method.


 **Note**  Connection points that have dual directionality (both inward and outward) are identified as either incoming or outgoing based on how they are used in a particular connection.
