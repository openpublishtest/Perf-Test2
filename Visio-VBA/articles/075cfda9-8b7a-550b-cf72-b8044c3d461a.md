# Cell.Units Property (Visio)

Indicates the unit of measure associated with a  **Cell** object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Units**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Cell** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks

The  **Units** property can be used to determine the unit of measure currently associated with a cell's value. The various unit codes are declared by the Visio type library in member **[VisUnitCodes ](fce91c1b-d5c2-6522-2446-0b8f6cacbc84.md)** . For example, a cell's width might be expressed in inches ( **visInches** ) or in centimeters ( **visCentimeters** ). In some cases, a program might behave differently depending on whether a cell's value is in metric or in imperial units.

For a list of valid unit codes, see [About Units of Measure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b6140312-b8e6-0cf2-9fe0-b14e800216bf%28Office.15%29.aspx).
