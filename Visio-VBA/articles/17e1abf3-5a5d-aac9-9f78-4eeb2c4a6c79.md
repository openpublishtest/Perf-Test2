# Application.TypelibMajorVersion Property (Visio)

Returns the major version number of the Microsoft Visio type library. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **TypelibMajorVersion**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks

The major and/or minor version number of the Visio type library will increase whenever the Visio type library is extended. A program can use the  **TypelibMajorVersion** and **TypelibMinorVersion** properties to guarantee that the Visio version it is working with provides support for the features it is using.

Small changes to the Visio type library do not affect the  **Application** object's **Version** property.
