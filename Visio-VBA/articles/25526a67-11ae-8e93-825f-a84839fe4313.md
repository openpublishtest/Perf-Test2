# ToolbarItems.Add Method (Visio)

Adds a new object to a collection.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Add**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **ToolbarItems** collection.


### Return Value

ToolbarItem


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

All properties of the new object are initialized to zero, so you need to set only the properties that you want to change.
