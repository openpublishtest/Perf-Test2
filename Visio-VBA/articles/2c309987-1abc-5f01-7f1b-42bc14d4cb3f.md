## Syntax

 _expression_ . **LiveDynamics**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **InvisibleApp** object.

## Remarks

The  **LiveDynamics** property tracks actions, such as resizing and rotating shapes, and is effective when shapes are glued or related to each other. When the value of the **LiveDynamics** property is **True** , more events such as **CellChanged** occur. Solutions that respond to such events may operate more quickly if the **LiveDynamics** property is set to **False** .
