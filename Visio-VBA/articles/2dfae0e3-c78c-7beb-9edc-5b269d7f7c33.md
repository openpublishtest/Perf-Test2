## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ptx**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **MSGWrap** object.

## Remarks

The  **ptx** property corresponds to the **pt.x** member in the **MSG** structure defined as part of the Microsoft Windows operating system. If an event handler is handling the **OnKeystrokeMessageForAddon** event, Microsoft Visio passes a **MSGWrap** object as an argument when this event fires. A **MSGWrap** object is a wrapper around the Windows **MSG** structure.
