Flags passed to various properties of the  **Shape** object, including the **DistanceFrom** , **DistanceFromPoint** , **SpatialNeighbors** , **SpatialRelation** , and **SpatialSearch** properties.



|**Constant**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visSpatialBackToFront**|&amp;H8|Order items back to front.|
| **visSpatialFrontToBack**|&amp;H4|Order items front to back.|
| **visSpatialIgnoreVisible**|&amp;H20|Do not consider visible Geometry sections. By default, visible Geometry sections influence the result.|
| **visSpatialIncludeContainerShapes**|&amp;H80|Include containers. By default, containers are not included.|
| **visSpatialIncludeDataGraphics**|&amp;H40|Include data graphic callout shapes and their sub-shapes. By default, data graphic callout shapes and their subshapes are not included.
