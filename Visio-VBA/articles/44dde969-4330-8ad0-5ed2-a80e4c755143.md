The index order of graphic items affects the stacking order for multiple grpahic item callouts assigned to the same location.

 **Note**  Before you can set any property of a graphic item, you must use the  **[Master.Open](3f14f3b2-1cfb-ccf9-b344-7fbf80ae9a26.md)** method to open a copy of the data graphic master that contains the graphic item for editing. When you are finished setting properties, use the **Master.Close** method to commit changes.
