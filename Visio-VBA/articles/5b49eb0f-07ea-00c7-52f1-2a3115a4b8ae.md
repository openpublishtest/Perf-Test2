# Window Object (Visio)

Represents an open window in a Microsoft Visio instance.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **Window** object is **Application** .

To retrieve


- the active window in an instance of Visio, use the  **ActiveWindow** property of an **Application** object.
    
- a  **Page** object that represents the page shown in the window, use the **Page** property of a **Window** object.
    
- a  **Document** object that represents the document displayed in that window, use the **Document** property.
    
- a  **Selection** object that represents the shapes selected in that window, use the **Selection** property.
    

 **Note**  Beginning with Microsoft Visio 2002, the following methods of the  **Window** object are obsolete: **AddToGroup** , **Cut** , **Combine** , **Copy** , **Delete** , **Duplicate** , **Fragment** , **Group** , **Intersect** , **Join RemoveFromGroup** , **Subtract** , **Trim** , and **Union** . Existing solutions that invoke these methods will continue to work properly; however, new or rebuilt solutions should use these methods with the **Selection** object.

In addition, the  **Window** object's **Paste** method is now obsolete. Use the **Paste** or **PasteSpecial** method of the **Page** , **Master** , or **Shape** object. (Use the **Shape** object in the case of group shapes.)
