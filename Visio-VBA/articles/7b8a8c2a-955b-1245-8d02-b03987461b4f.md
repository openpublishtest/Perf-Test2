## Syntax

## Remarks

If an object is a reference to an entity in a document, and if that document closes, the  **Stat** property returns a value in which the **visStatClosed** bit is set.

A Component Object Model (COM) object, such as a Microsoft Visio  **[Document](21640062-13a2-a2b2-7c61-7e707671207c.md)** object, lives as long as it is held (pointed to) by a client, even if the object is logically in a deleted or closed state.
