# Selection.AddToContainers Method (Visio)

Adds the selection of shapes to all underlying containers that allow it as a member.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AddToContainers**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Selection](e5734140-6dbe-7de8-9695-1a22fb4ac628.md)** object.


### Return Value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

When you call the  **AddToContainers** method, Microsoft Visio uses the setting of the **[ContainerProperties.ResizeAsNeeded](13bd0493-95fd-73bf-454c-a39c69589bcd.md)** property for each container to determine how the container resizes.

Each shape in the selection is added to its underlying containers according to the position of the shape. As a result, different shapes may end up being contained by different containers. If the underlying container is a list, the shape is added as normal container member, not list member.

The  **AddToContainers** method works only if the selection sits at least partially on top of a container that does not already contain it.
