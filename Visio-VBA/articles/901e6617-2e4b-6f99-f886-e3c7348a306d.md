# Characters.FieldCode Property (Visio)

Returns the field code for a field represented by an object. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Characters** object.

If the  **Characters** object does not contain a field or contains non-field characters, the **FieldCode** property returns an exception. Check the **IsField** property of the **Characters** object before getting its **FieldCode** property.

Field codes correspond to the fields in the  **Field** list in the **Field** dialog box (click **Field** on the **Insert** tab).

Constants for field codes are declared by the Microsoft Visio type library in  **[VisFieldCodes](3bcc4aef-21c1-b152-47dc-74e6c58cd24e.md)** .
