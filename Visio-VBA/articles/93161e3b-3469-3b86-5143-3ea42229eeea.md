# VisWebPageSettings.SilentMode Property (Visio Save As Web)

Determines whether any component of the user interface (either that of Microsoft Visio or that of the browser) is displayed when a drawing is saved as a Web page. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **SilentMode**

 _expression_An expression that returns a  ** [VisWebPageSettings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/14280ea7-e8b1-d4b2-941b-121f2c17f787%28Office.15%29.aspx)** object.


### Return Value

Long


## Remarks

Set  **SilentMode** to a non-zero value ( **True**) to prevent any component of the user interface from appearing when a drawing is saved as a Web page; set it to zero ( **False**) to allow dialog boxes to be displayed. The default is  **False**.

Setting the  **SilentMode** property to **True** overrides the setting of the **[OpenBrowser](701defdf-9f1c-b136-0af5-48605d255f88.md)** property and prevents newly created Web pages from opening in the default browser automatically.

To control only the display of dialog boxes in the Visio user interface, use the  **[QuietMode](1bdc15d9-a4f3-de94-d6ed-4da508d98581.md)** property.

If both the  **QuietMode** and **SilentMode** properties are set to **True**, the  **SilentMode** property takes precedence and no user interface components are displayed.
