# Shapes Object (Visio)

Includes a  **Shape** object for each basic shape, group, guide, or object from another application (linked or embedded in Microsoft Visio) on a drawing page, master, or group.


## Remarks

To retrieve a  **Shapes** collection, use the **Shapes** property of a **Page** , **Master** , or **Shape** object.

The default property of a  **Shapes** collection is **Item** .

The order of items in a  **Shapes** collection corresponds to the stacking (drawing) order of the shapes.
