# Application.AlertResponse Property (Visio)

Determines whether Microsoft Visio shows alerts and modal dialog boxes to the user. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AlertResponse**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks

Certain operations, such as closing a document that has unsaved modifications, cause Visio to display an alert or modal dialog box requesting the user to supply a response such as  **OK**,  **Yes**,  **No**, or  **Cancel**. To prevent Visio from displaying an alert or modal dialog box when a program performs such an action, set the  **AlertResponse** property to a default value for the response. In this case, Visio does not display the alert or modal dialog box; instead, Visio behaves as if the user responded to the alert or modal dialog box with the value of the **AlertResponse** property.

If the  **AlertResponse** property is 0 (its default value), alerts and modal dialog boxes are displayed.

The values you supply for the  **AlertResponse** property correspond to the standard Windows constants IDOK, IDCANCEL, and so forth.
