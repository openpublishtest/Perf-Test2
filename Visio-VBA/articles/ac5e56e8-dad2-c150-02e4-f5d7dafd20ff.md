# Curve.Start Property (Visio)

Returns the start of a  **Curve** object's parameter domain. Read-only.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Start**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **Curve** object.


### Return Value

Double


## Remarks

The  **Start** property of a **Curve** object returns the value of the starting point in the curve's parameter domain. A **Curve** object describes itself in terms of its parameter domain, which is the range [Start(),End()], where Start() produces the curve's starting point. Note that the **Start** value is not a coordinate pair. Rather, it represents the relative position along the curve of the starting point. For a line, for example, the value of **Start** typically is 0, the value of **End** is 1, and you can use the **Point** method of the **Curve** object to determine the coordinates of any point along the curve by determining the relative location of the point between the start and endpoints.


## Example

This Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro shows how to use the  **Start** property to display the value of the starting point of a curve. It uses the **Point** method to find the midpoint of the curve.
