# Visio VBA reference

This reference contains conceptual overviews, programming tasks, samples, and references to guide you in developing solutions based on Visio.

 >**Note**  Interested in developing solutions that extend the Office experience across [multiple platforms](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability)? Check out the new [Office Add-ins model](http://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins).

It includes:


- An overview of using Automation with Visio.

- A sample Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro.
    
- Information about common Automation tasks, such as starting the Visual Basic Editor; viewing Visio object, property, method, enumeration, and event descriptions in the Object Browser; connecting to data sources, linking shapes to data, and displaying shape data graphically; and running macros and add-ons.
    
- Information about using the Visio Drawing Control to integrate Visio into third-party applications.
