# VisGluedShapesFlags Enumeration (Visio)

Specifies constants that identify which shapes to return, based on the dimensionality and directionality of the connection points that are glued to a particular shape; passed to the  **[Shapes.GluedShapes](0c9c551d-ce28-f7c6-4656-8120962e8d34.md)** method.



|**Name**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **visGluedShapesAll1D**|0|Return all 1-D shapes that are glued to this shape.|
| **visGluedShapesIncoming1D**|1|Return the 1-D shapes whose end points are glued to this shape.|
| **visGluedShapesOutgoing1D**|2|Return the 1-D shapes whose begin points are glued to this shape.|
| **visGluedShapesAll2D**|3|Return the 2-D shapes that are glued to this shape and the 2-D shapes to which this shape is glued. |
| **visGluedShapesIncoming2D**|4|If the source object is a 1-D shape, return the 2-D shape to which the begin point is glued. If the source object is a 2-D shape, return the 2-D shapes that are glued to this shape.|
| **visGluedShapesOutgoing2D**|5|If the source object is a 1-D shape, return the 2-D shape to which the end point is glued. If the source object is a 2-D shape, return the 2-D shapes to which this shape is glued.|
