# InvisibleApp.ShowToolbar Property (Visio)

Determines whether toolbars and menu bars are visible. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ShowToolbar**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **InvisibleApp** object.


### Return Value

Integer


## Remarks


 **Note**  Starting with Visio, the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface (UI) replaces the previous system of layered menus, toolbars, and task panes. VBA objects and members that you used to customize the user interface in previous versions of Visio are still available in Visio, but they function differently.

The  **ShowToolbar** property is valid for a Microsoft Visio instance only. The **ShowStatusBar** property persists each time you run Visio.
