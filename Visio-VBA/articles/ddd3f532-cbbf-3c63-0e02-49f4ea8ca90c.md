# Shape.AddToContainers Method (Visio)

Adds the shape to all underlying containers that allow it as a member.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **AddToContainers**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Shape](da7a8872-4ebb-a607-e0ed-eebf68ff5630.md)** object.


### Return Value

 **Nothing**


## Remarks

When you call the  **AddToContainers** method, Microsoft Visio uses the setting of the **[ContainerProperties.ResizeAsNeeded](13bd0493-95fd-73bf-454c-a39c69589bcd.md)** property for each container to determine how the container resizes.

If the underlying container is a list, the shape is added as a normal container member, and not as a list member.

The  **AddToContainers** method works only if the shape sits at least partially on top of a container that does not already contain it.
