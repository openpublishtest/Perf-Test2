# MovedSelectionEvent Object (Visio)

Holds information about a selection that is moved from one location, such as a page or a document, to another.


## Remarks

When you move a selection of shapes to a sub-process page, Microsoft Visio fires the  **SelectionMovedToSubprocess** event ( **[AddAdvise](b58e086f-59d2-9e63-5df3-3001b58bb2c1.md)** -only), which returns a **MovedSelectionEvent** object that encapsulates information about the move.
