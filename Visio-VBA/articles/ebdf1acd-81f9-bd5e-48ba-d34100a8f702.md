## Syntax

 _expression_ . **TimeRefreshed**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **DataRecordset** object.


### Return Value

Date


## Remarks

The  **TimeRefreshed** property value is returned in Coordinated Universal Time (Greenwich Mean Time).

If you successfully create a data recordset but it fails to retrieve any data from the data source,  **TimeRefreshed** returns zero.

The first time you execute a query against a data recordset,  **TimeRefreshed** is set to the time the query is executed. If, subsequently, the **[Refresh](0a871f32-f24e-07c0-3cc6-a76f2a4ba2e2.md)** method is called, **TimeRefreshed** is set to the time the data recordset is refreshed.
