# Bookmark.End Property (Word)

Returns or sets the ending character position of a selection, range, or bookmark. Read/write  **Long** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **End**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Bookmark](be6b0c7b-60ca-97e7-ef19-6de335da3197.md)** object.


## Remarks

If this property is set to a value smaller than the  **[Start](42b44a7c-0d2a-daa6-a5ec-ef54d01cb5c3.md)** property, the **Start** property is set to the same value (that is, the **Start** and **End** properties are equal).

This property returns the ending character position relative to the beginning of the story. The main document story (wdMainTextStory) begins with character position 0 (zero). You can change the size of a bookmark by setting this property.


## Example

This example compares the ending position of the "temp" bookmark with the starting position of the "begin" bookmark.


```vb
Set Book1 = ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("begin") 
Set Book2 = ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("temp") 
If Book2.End > Book1.Start Then Book1.Select
```
