# Comment Object (Word)

Represents a single comment. The  **Comment** object is a member of the **[Comments](e384b37a-50e3-a214-52a8-6fda2acc4991.md)** collection. The **Comments** collection includes comments in a selection, range or document.


## Remarks

Use  **Comments** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **Comment** object. The index number represents the position of the comment in the specified selection, range, or document. The following example displays the author of the first comment in the active document.


```
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Comments(1).Author
```

Use the  **[Add](bf3e2f9b-b7d6-f669-c82a-70ff58aaedfe.md)** method to add a comment at the specified range. The following example adds a comment immediately after the selection.




```
Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
ActiveDocument.Comments.Add Range:=Selection.Range, _ 
 Text:="review this"
```

Use the  **[Reference](7bba174c-f6f2-eb30-6f41-4d8343f9f98a.md)** property to return the reference mark associated with the specified comment. Use the **[Range](1a67e361-67ee-0fb1-ffe4-9e15aa73e2a2.md)** property to return the text associated with the specified comment.
