# AddIn.Path Property (Word)

Returns the location of an installed add-in. Read-only  **String** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Path**

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[AddIn](5615a8a9-1fd6-04fa-1fee-ec16502bd84a.md)** object.


## Remarks

The path doesn't include a trailing characterâ€” for example, "C:\MSOffice" or "http://MyServer". Use the  **PathSeparator** property to add the character that separates folders and drive letters. Use the **Name** property to return the file name without the path and use the **FullName** property to return the file name and the path together.


 **Note**  You can use the  **PathSeparator** property to build Web addresses even though they contain forward slashes (/) and the **PathSeparator** property defaults to a backslash (\).


## Example

This example displays the path of the first add-in in the  **AddIns** collection.


```vb
If AddIns.Count >= 1 Then MsgBox AddIns(1).Path
```
