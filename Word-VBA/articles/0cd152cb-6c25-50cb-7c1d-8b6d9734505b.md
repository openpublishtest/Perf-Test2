# ListLevel Object (Word)

Represents a single list level, either the only level for a bulleted or numbered list or one of the nine levels of an outline numbered list. The  **ListLevel** object is a member of the **ListLevels** collection.


## Remarks

Use  **ListLevels** (Index), where Index is a number from 1 through 9, to return a single **ListLevel** object. The following example sets list level one of list template one in the active document to start at 4.


```
ActiveDocument.ListTemplates(1).ListLevels(1).StartAt = 4
```

The  **ListLevel** object gives you access to all the formatting properties for the specified list level, such as the **Alignment** , **Font** , **NumberFormat** , **NumberPosition** , **NumberStyle** , and **TrailingCharacter** properties.

To apply a list level, first identify the range or list, and then use the  **ApplyListTemplate** method. Each tab at the beginning of the paragraph is translated into a list level. For example, a paragraph that begins with three tabs will become a level-three list paragraph after the **ApplyListTemplate** method is used.
