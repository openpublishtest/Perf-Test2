# Range Object (Word)

Represents a contiguous area in a document. Each  **Range** object is defined by a starting and ending character position.


## Remarks

Similar to the way bookmarks are used in a document,  **Range** objects are used in Visual Basic procedures to identify specific portions of a document. However, unlike a bookmark, a **Range** object only exists while the procedure that defined it is running. **Range** objects are independent of the selection. That is, you can define and manipulate a range without changing the selection. You can also define multiple ranges in a document, while there can be only one selection per pane.

Use the  **Range** method to return a **Range** object defined by the given starting and ending character positions. The following example returns a **Range** object that refers to the first 10 characters in the active document.




```
Set myRange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=0, End:=10)
```

Use the  **Range** property to return a **Range** object defined by the beginning and end of another object. The **Range** property applies to many objects (for example, **Paragraph** , **Bookmark** , and **Cell** ). The following example returns a **Range** object that refers to the first paragraph in the active document.




```
Set aRange = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range
```

The following example returns a  **Range** object that refers to the second through fourth paragraphs in the active document




```
Set aRange = ActiveDocument.Range( _ 
 Start:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(2).Range.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(4).Range.End)
```
