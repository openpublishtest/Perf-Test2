# Selecting Text in a Document

Use the  **Select**method to select an item in a document. The  **Select** method is available from several objects, such as **[Bookmark](be6b0c7b-60ca-97e7-ef19-6de335da3197.md)**,  **[Field](75139aa4-89f4-2ffb-b964-8dc805b9a32b.md)**,  **[Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)**, and  **[Table](996b58dd-ebc6-ee30-5bfe-c5e51a0f71d6.md)**. The following example selects the first table in the active document.


```vb
Sub SelectTable() 
 ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Select 
End Sub
```


The following example selects the first field in the active document.




```vb
Sub SelectField() 
 ActiveDocument.Fields(1).Select 
End Sub
```

The following example selects the first four paragraphs in the active document. The  **Range**method is used to create a  **Range** object that refers to the first four paragraphs. The **Select** method is then applied to the **Range** object.



```vb
Sub SelectRange() 
 Dim rngParagraphs As Range 
 Set rngParagraphs = ActiveDocument.Range( _ 
 Start:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range.Start, _ 
 End:=ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(4).Range.End) 
 rngParagraphs.Select 
End Sub
```
