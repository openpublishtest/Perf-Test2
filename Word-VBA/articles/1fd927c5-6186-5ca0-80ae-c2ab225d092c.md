# Lists Object (Word)

A collection of  **List** objects that represent all the lists in the specified document.


## Remarks

Use the  **Lists** property to return the **Lists** collection. The following example displays the number of items in each list in the active document.


```vb
For Each li In ActiveDocument.Lists 
 MsgBox li.CountNumberedItems 
Next li
```

Use  **Lists** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **[List](2c3dae28-447a-af48-2966-e19ae75ab6c2.md)** object. The following example applies the first list format (excluding **None**) on the  **Numbered** tab in the **Bullets and Numbering** dialog box to the second list in the active document.




```
Set temp1 = ListGalleries(wdNumberGallery).ListTemplates(1) 
ActiveDocument.Lists(2).ApplyListTemplate ListTemplate:=temp1
```

When you use a  **For Each** loop to enumerate the **Lists** collection, the lists in a document are returned in reverse order. The following example counts the items for each list in the active document, from the bottom of the document upward.




```vb
For Each li In ActiveDocument.Lists 
 MsgBox li.CountNumberedItems 
Next li
```

To add a new list to a document, use the  **ApplyListTemplate** method with the **[ListFormat](74773fd6-b713-34d4-b7be-f543c983008d.md)** object for a specified range.

You can manipulate the individual  **[List](2c3dae28-447a-af48-2966-e19ae75ab6c2.md)** objects within a document, but for more precise control you should work with the **ListFormat** object.


 **Note**  Picture-bulleted lists are not included in the  **Lists** collection.
