# OMathBox.OpEmu Property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Boolean** that represents that the box and its contents behave as a single operator and inherit the properties of an operator. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **OpEmu**

 _expression_ An expression that returns an **[OMathBox](e744ed0f-99de-f13f-766d-5453fb61ed48.md)** object.


## Remarks

When the OpEmu property is  **True** , the character can serve as a point for a line break and can be aligned to other operators. Operator emulators are often used when one or more glyphs combine to form an operator, such as ==.
