# List Object (Word)

Represents a single list format that's been applied to specified paragraphs in a document. The  **List** object is a member of the **Lists** collection.


## Remarks

Use  **Lists** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **List** object. The following example returns the number of items in list one in the active document.


```
mycount = ActiveDocument.Lists(1).CountNumberedItems
```

To return all the paragraphs that have list formatting, use the  **ListParagraphs** property. To return them as a range, use the **Range** property.

To apply a different list format to an existing list, use the  **ApplyListTemplate** method with the **List** object. To add a new list to a document, use the **ApplyListTemplate** method with the **[ListFormat](74773fd6-b713-34d4-b7be-f543c983008d.md)** object for a specified range.

Use the  **CanContinuePreviousList** method to determine whether you can continue the list formatting from a list that was previously applied to the document.

Use the  **CountNumberedItems** method to return the number of items in a numbered or bulleted list, including LISTNUM fields.

To determine whether a list contains more than one list template, use the  **SingleListTemplate** property.

You can manipulate the individual  **List** objects within a document, but for more precise control you should work with the **ListFormat** object.


 **Note**  Picture-bulleted lists are not included in the  **[Lists](1fd927c5-6186-5ca0-80ae-c2ab225d092c.md)** collection and cannot be manipulated using the **List** object.
