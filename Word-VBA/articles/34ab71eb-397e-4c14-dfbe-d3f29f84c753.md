## Syntax

 _expression_ . **UserControl**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.

```vb
Set wd = New Word.Application 
Set wdDoc = _ 
 wd.Documents.Open("C:\My Documents\doc1.doc") 
If wdDoc.UserControl = True Then 
 MsgBox "This document was created or opened by the user." 
Else 
 MsgBox "This document was created programmatically." 
End If
```
