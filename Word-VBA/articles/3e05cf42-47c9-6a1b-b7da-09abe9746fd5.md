# Application.Quit Event (Word)

Occurs when the user exits Microsoft Word.


## Syntax

Private Sub Application_**Quit**()

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **[Application](d1cf6f8f-4e88-bf01-93b4-90a83f79cb44.md)** object that has been declared with events in a class module.


## Remarks

For information about using events with the  **Application** object, see[Using Events with the Application Object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1%28Office.15%29.aspx).


## Example

This example ensures that the  **Standard** and **Formatting** toolbars are visible before the user exits Word. As a result, when Word is started again, the **Standard** and **Formatting** toolbars are visible.

This code must be placed in a class module, and an instance of the class must be correctly initialized to see this example work; see [Using Events with the Application Object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/784c4c61-7e47-3dbf-46f6-da655f786ca1%28Office.15%29.aspx)for directions on how to accomplish this.




```vb
Public WithEvents appWord as Word.Application 
 
Private Sub appWord_Quit() 
 CommandBars("Standard").Visible = True 
 CommandBars("Formatting").Visible = True 
End Sub
```
