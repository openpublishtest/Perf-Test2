# Browser Object (Word)

Represents the browser tool used to move the insertion point to objects in a document. This tool is composed of the three buttons at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar.


## Remarks

Use the  **[Browser](79b1967d-e661-8953-7bb2-a35eadbfae54.md)** property to return the **Browser** object. The following example moves the insertion point just before the next field in the active document.


```vb
With Application.Browser 
 .Target = wdBrowseField 
 .Next 
End With
```

The following example moves the insertion point to the previous table and selects it.




```vb
With Application.Browser 
 .Target = wdBrowseTable 
 .Previous 
End With 
If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) = True Then 
 Selection.Tables(1).Select 
End If
```
