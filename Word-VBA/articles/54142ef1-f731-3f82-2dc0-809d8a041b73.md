# XMLSchemaReference Object (Word)

Represents an individual schema that is attached to a document.


## Remarks

Use the  **XMLSchemaReference** property to return an **XMLSchemaReference** object for a **ChildNodeSuggestion** object. The following example inserts the suggested XML child element if the XML schema referenced is the SimpleSample schema.


```vb
Dim objSuggestion As XMLChildNodeSuggestion 
 
For Each objSuggestion In ActiveDocument _ 
 .ChildNodeSuggestions 
 
 If objSuggestion.XMLSchemaReference = "SimpleSample" Then 
 objSuggestion.Insert 
 End If 
 
Next
```


 **Note**  The SimpleSample schema is included in the Smart Document Software Development Kit (SDK). For more information, refer to the Smart Document SDK on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site.
