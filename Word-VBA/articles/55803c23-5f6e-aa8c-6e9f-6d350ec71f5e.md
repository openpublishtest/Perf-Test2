# ShapeNode Members (Word)
Represents the geometry and the geometry-editing properties of the nodes in a user-defined freeform. Nodes include the vertices between the segments of the freeform and the control points for curved segments. The  **ShapeNode** object is a member of the **ShapeNodes** collection. The **[ShapeNodes](f2e13db2-102f-1a14-fd7a-d179f63e513e.md)** collection contains all the nodes in a freeform.
