# Replacement Object (Word)

Represents the replace criteria for a find-and-replace operation. The properties and methods of the  **Replacement** object correspond to the options in the **Find and Replace** dialog box.


## Remarks

Use the  **Replacement** property to return a **Replacement** object. The following example replaces the next occurrence of the word "hi" with the word "hello."


```vb
With Selection.Find 
 .Text = "hi" 
 .ClearFormatting 
 .Replacement.Text = "hello" 
 .Replacement.ClearFormatting 
 .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceOne, Forward:=True 
End With
```

To find and replace formatting, set both the find text and the replace text to empty strings ("") and set the Format argument of the  **Execute** method to **True** . The following example removes all the bold formatting in the active document. The **Bold** property is **True** for the **Find** object and **False** for the **Replacement** object.




```vb
With ActiveDocument.Content.Find 
 .ClearFormatting 
 .Font.Bold = True 
 .Text = "" 
 With .Replacement 
 .ClearFormatting 
 .Font.Bold = False 
 .Text = "" 
 End With 
 .Execute Format:=True, Replace:=wdReplaceAll 
End With
```
