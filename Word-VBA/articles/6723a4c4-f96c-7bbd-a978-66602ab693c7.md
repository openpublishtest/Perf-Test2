# Set the Building Blocks That You Can Use for a Content Control

A document building block is a predesigned piece of content, such as a cover page or a header or footer. Word includes a library of document building blocks that users can choose from to insert into a document. 

A  [ContentControl Object (Word)](783dec26-9b63-11f8-6187-985f9c815f27.md) object with a [ContentControl.Type Property (Word)](24f4099d-b4ad-c7be-60a4-e23ede378208.md) property value of **wdContentControlBuildingBlockGallery** specifies a content control that can contain document building blocks.

The  **[WdBuildingBlockTypes](be7fcedb-04fd-f27d-8f36-3120ca263f06.md)** enumeration contains each building block type. You can only use the following building block types within a building block gallery content control:


- AutoText
    
- Tables
    
- Equations
    
- Quick Parts
    
- Custom 1 though Custom 5
    
- Custom AutoText
    
- Custom Tables
    
- Custom Equations
    
- Custom Quick Parts

## Sample

The following code sample instantiates a building block gallery content control and then adds a building block to the content control.


```vb
Sub SetBuildingBlock()
 
    Dim strTitle As String
    strTitle = "My Equation"
    Dim objContentControl As ContentControl
     
    Set objContentControl = ActiveDocument.ContentControls _
        .Add(wdContentControlBuildingBlockGallery)
    objContentControl.Title = strTitle
    objContentControl.BuildingBlockType = wdTypeEquations
   
End Sub
```
