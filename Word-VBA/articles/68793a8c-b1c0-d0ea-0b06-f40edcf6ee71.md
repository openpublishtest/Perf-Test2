# Adjustments Members (Word)
Contains a collection of adjustment values for the specified AutoShape or WordArt object. Each adjustment value represents one way an adjustment handle can be adjusted. Because some adjustment handles can be adjusted in two ways ? for instance, some handles can be adjusted both horizontally and vertically ? a shape can have more adjustment values than it has adjustment handles. A shape can have up to eight adjustments.
