# Prompting for Information

There are several different ways you can prompt for information from a user.


- Use the Visual Basic  **InputBox** function to display a dialog box with a message and an edit box. When the user clicks **OK**, the function returns the text that the user entered.
    
- Use the Visual Basic  **MsgBox** function to display a simple message. You can display several different command buttons and icons. This function returns a number that indicates which button was clicked.
    
- Use a  [built-in Microsoft Word dialog box](abe465f9-09a1-72ea-2e2d-9de14fc02434.md)to get user input for a specific Word feature.
    
- Use a custom form to get user input. For information about adding controls to a form, see  [Add a control to a form](9cf47c7e-c768-0ea9-bbb9-f5a4770eea79.md).
