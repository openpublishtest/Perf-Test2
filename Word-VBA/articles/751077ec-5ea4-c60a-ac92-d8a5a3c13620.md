# Range.ShowAll Property (Word)

 **True** if all nonprinting characters (such as hidden text, tab marks, space marks, and paragraph marks) are displayed. Read/write **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ShowAll**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Range](15a7a1c4-5f3f-5b6e-60e9-29688de3f274.md)** object.


## Remarks

This property only affects the specified range when  **Show Markup** is set to **Show Revisions in Balloons**. When  **Range.ShowAll** is set to **False**,  **[Range.Text](495fe06e-ba87-0d96-9f6e-3e62fd71d4a5.md)** provides all of the text in the range except deleted text. If you set **Range.ShowAll** to **True**, then  **[Range.Text](495fe06e-ba87-0d96-9f6e-3e62fd71d4a5.md)** provides all of the text in the range including the text that was deleted.


## Example

The following example displays all the text in the specified range, excluding deleted text.


 **Note**  This example assumes that the active document has change tracking enabled, that  **Show Markup** is set to **Show Revisions in Balloons**, and that some text has been deleted from the document.


```vb
Sub HideDeletedText()
Dim r As Range

Set r = ActiveDocument.Range
r.ShowAll = False
Debug.Print r.Text

End Sub
```
