# ChartArea Object (Word)

Represents the chart area of a chart. 


## Remarks

The chart area includes everything, including the plot area. However, the  **[PlotArea](72d30767-7cfc-3063-0b49-f9fbc129a52c.md)** object has its own formatting, so formatting the plot area does not format the chart area.

Use the  **[ChartArea](b16d78c0-7663-3ef9-c17a-02e7a024b344.md)** property to return the **ChartArea** object.


## Example

The following example turns off the border for the chart area in the first chart of the active document.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(1).Chart 
 ChartArea.Format.Line.Visible = False 
End With
```
