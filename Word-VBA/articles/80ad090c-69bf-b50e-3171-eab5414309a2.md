# Document.Open Event (Word)

## Syntax

Private Sub  _expression_ _**Private Sub Document_Open**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Document](8d83487a-2345-a036-a916-971c9db5b7fb.md)** object.


## Remarks

If the event procedure is stored in a template, the procedure will run when a new document based on that template is opened and when the template itself is opened as a document.
