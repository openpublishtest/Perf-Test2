# ThreeDFormat.RotationX Property (Word)

Returns or sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis in degrees. Read/write  **Single** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **RotationX**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[ThreeDFormat](d397e780-a53d-0cc3-7a02-b40397253e91.md)** object.


## Remarks

The  **RotationX** property can be a value from - 90 through 90. A positive value indicates upward rotation; a negative value indicates downward rotation.

To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis, use the  **[RotationY](64ebb9d9-4338-3672-9149-e1e82ba8abdc.md)** property of the ThreeDFormat object. To set the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis, use the **[Rotation](7a66bdd7-ffda-64f2-8228-c1bce6d0640b.md)** property of the **[Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)** object. To change the direction of the extrusion's sweep path without rotating the front face of the extrusion, use the **[SetExtrusionDirection](651b2b17-d87b-0007-3722-dc330f3e1f2e.md)** method.


## Example

This example adds three identical extruded ovals to the active document and sets their rotation around the x-axis to - 30, 0, and 30 degrees, respectively.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 30, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = -30 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 90, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = 0 
 End With 
 With .AddShape(msoShapeOval, 150, 60, 50, 25).ThreeD 
 .Visible = True 
 .RotationX = 30 
 End With 
End With
```
