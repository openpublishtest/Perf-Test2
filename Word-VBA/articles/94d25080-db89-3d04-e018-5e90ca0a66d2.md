# Creating a Custom Dialog Box

Use the following procedure to create a custom dialog box:


1.  [Create a UserForm](90f89a38-112f-870a-d631-840b09e3cd12.md)
    
    On the  **Insert** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, click **UserForm**.
    
2.  [Add controls to the UserForm](c752df00-d70c-ca1e-9a56-17f9bf952f48.md)
    
    Find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox** and drag the control onto the form.
    
3.  [Set control properties](b8472d6c-4f48-3953-8adc-f3573583136f.md)
    
    Right-click a control in design mode and click  **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.
    
4.  [Initialize the controls](18ae617c-6d51-ae79-be3c-1493ce4f6ef3.md)
    
    You can initialize controls in a procedure before you show a form, or you can add code to the  **Initialize** event of the form.
    
5.  [Write event procedures](7884bae3-caa5-79a9-a4a2-c58a6ccb42d2.md)
    
    All controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a  **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button. You can write event procedures that run when the events occur.
    
6.  [Show the dialog box](edda05bb-092c-1352-671a-1349b58d5ba4.md)
    
    Use the  **Show**method to display a UserForm.
    
7.  [Use control values while code is running](62722982-6725-57e2-099e-c31d0aefadd3.md)
    
    Some properties can be set at run time. Values the user sets for controls in the dialog box are lost when the dialog box is closed.
