# WebOptions.OrganizeInFolder Property (Word)

 **True** if all supporting files, such as background textures and graphics, are organized in a separate folder when you save the specified document as a Web page. **False** if supporting files are saved in the same folder as the Web page. The default value is **True** . Read/write **Boolean** .


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **OrganizeInFolder**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[WebOptions](658ae89d-3f92-067b-1309-7fc90b257111.md)** collection.


## Remarks

The new folder is created in the folder where you have saved the Web page and is named after the document. If long file names are used, a suffix is added to the folder name. The  **[FolderSuffix](3661519e-3f69-8cff-3674-40921fd00709.md)** property returns wither the folder suffix for the language support you have selected or installed or the default folder suffix.

If you save a document that was previously saved with the  **OrganizeInFolder** property set to a different value, Microsoft Word automatically moves the supporting files into or out of the folder, as appropriate.

If you don't use long file names (that is, if the  **[UseLongFileNames](25676029-e480-ac84-076a-95d3a41a800d.md)** property is set to **False** ), Microsoft Word automatically saves any supporting files in a separate folder. The files cannot be saved in the same folder as the Web page.


## Example

This example specifies that all supporting files are saved in the same folder when the document is saved as a Web page.


```vb
Application.DefaultWebOptions.OrganizeInFolder = False
```
