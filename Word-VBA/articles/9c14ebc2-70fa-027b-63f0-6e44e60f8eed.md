# Shape.Left Property (Word)

Returns or sets a  **Single** that represents the horizontal position, measured in points, of the specified shape or shape range. Can also be any valid **[WdShapePosition](6506f482-1a86-855e-66ef-e81ef9f52bc7.md)** constant. Read/write.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **Left**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Shape](604029ce-9b2f-9748-5d4e-b458796fa2f0.md)** object.


## Remarks

The position of a shape is measured from the upper-left corner of the shape's bounding box to the shape's anchor. The  **RelativeHorizontalPosition** property controls whether the anchor is positioned alongside a character, column, margin, or the edge of the page.


## Example

This example sets the horizontal position of the first shape in the active document to 1 inch from the left edge of the page.


```vb
With ActiveDocument.Shapes(1) 
 .RelativeHorizontalPosition = _ 
 wdRelativeHorizontalPositionPage 
 .Left = InchesToPoints(1) 
End With
```
