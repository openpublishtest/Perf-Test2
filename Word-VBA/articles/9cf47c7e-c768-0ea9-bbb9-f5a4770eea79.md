# Adding Controls to a Document

You can add  [ActiveX controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/befa20c2-c4e7-1a53-7740-248885691710%28Office.15%29.aspx)to a document's drawing layer or text layer. To add a control to the drawing layer, click the control on the  **Control Toolbox**. Drag an adjustment handle of the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want. To add a control to the text layer, hold down the SHIFT key while you click a control on the  **Control Toolbox**. The control is automatically added to the document at the insertion point.


 **Note**  Dragging a control (or a number of "grouped" controls) from the form back to the  **Control Toolbox** creates a template of that control, which can be reused. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard interface for your applications.
