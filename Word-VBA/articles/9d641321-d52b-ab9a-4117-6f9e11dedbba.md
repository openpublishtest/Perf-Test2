# EmailSignature Object (Word)

Contains information about the e-mail signatures used by Microsoft Word when you create and edit e-mail messages and replies.


## Remarks

Use the  **EmailSignature** property to return the **EmailSignature** object.

This example changes the signatures Word appends to new outgoing e-mail messages and e-mail message replies.




```vb
With Application.EmailOptions.EmailSignature 
 .NewMessageSignature = "Signature1" 
 .ReplyMessageSignature = "Reply2" 
End With
```


 **Note**  There is no EmailSignatures collection; each  **[EmailOptions](41fefa03-c993-e218-0f92-0cf30c0bfbd4.md)** object contains only one **EmailSignature** object.
