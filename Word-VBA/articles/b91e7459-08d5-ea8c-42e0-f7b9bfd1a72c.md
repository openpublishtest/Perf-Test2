# Global Object (Word)

Contains top-level properties and methods that do not need to be preceded by the  **Application** property.


## Remarks

The following two statements have the same result. One statement uses the  **Application** property to access the **Documents** collection, and one does not. Both statements are equal and achieve the same result.


```vb
Documents(1).Content.Bold = True 
Application.Documents(1).Content.Bold = True
```
