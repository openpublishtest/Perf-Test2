# Paragraphs Object (Word)

A collection of  **[Paragraph](0a704079-a082-4ab1-841b-fc0d49dd26d4.md)** objects in a selection, range, or document.


## Remarks

Use the  **Paragraphs** property to return the **Paragraphs** collection. The following example formats the selected paragraphs to be double-spaced and right-aligned.


```vb
With Selection.Paragraphs 
 .Alignment = wdAlignParagraphRight 
 .LineSpacingRule = wdLineSpaceDouble 
End With
```

Use the  **Add** , **InsertParagraph** , **InsertParagraphAfter** , or **InsertParagraphBefore** method to add a new paragraph to a document. The following example adds a new paragraph before the first paragraph in the selection.




```
Selection.Paragraphs.Add Range:=Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range
```

The following example also adds a paragraph before the first paragraph in the selection.




```
Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range.InsertParagraphBefore
```

Use  **Paragraphs** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **Paragraph** object. The following example right aligns the first paragraph in the active document.




```
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Alignment = wdAlignParagraphRight
```

The  **Count** property for this collection in a document returns the number of items in the main story only. To count items in other stories use the collection with the **Range** object.
