# Templates.LoadBuildingBlocks Method (Word)

Loads the building blocks for all templates into Microsoft Word.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **LoadBuildingBlocks**

 _expression_ An expression that returns a **[Templates](de62f768-011a-7446-48c3-1c4512da5f7c.md)** object.


## Remarks

Word normally loads building blocks when they are first needed, for example when a user displays a gallery by using the ribbon. This method forces Word to immediately load all building blocks.
