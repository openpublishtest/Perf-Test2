# CoAuthor Object (Word)

Represents a single co-author in the document. The  **CoAuthor** object is a member of the **[CoAuthors](47fc864d-5f1b-b113-85b5-6e8b1b75c225.md)** collection. The **CoAuthors** collection contains all the co-authors in the document (authors that are actively editing the document).


 **Important**  Documents can only be co-authored on a server that supports the File Synchronization via SOAP over HTTP protocol, such as Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010.


## Remarks

Use  **CoAuthors** ( _Index_ ), where _Index_ is the index number to return a single **CoAuthor** object.


 **Note**  When a new co-author begins to edit the document, it can take up to one minute or longer for the co-author to appear in the document.


## Example

The following code example returns the name of the first co-author in the active document.


```
Dim author As CoAuthor 
 
Set author = ActiveDocument.CoAuthoring.Authors(1) 
MsgBox "The name of the first co-author in this document is " &amp; author.Name
```
