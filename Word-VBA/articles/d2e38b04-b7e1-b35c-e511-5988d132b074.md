# KeyBindings Object (Word)

A collection of  **[KeyBinding](0f691196-76ef-135d-a8c9-b2fb9f9ac695.md)** objects that represent the custom key assignments in the current context. Custom key assignments are made in the **Customize Keyboard** dialog box.


## Remarks

Use the  **[KeyBindings](68e08a9a-6547-f722-078e-b603b9f3e9cb.md)** property to return the **KeyBindings** collection. The following example inserts after the selection the command name and key combination for each item in the **KeyBindings** collection.


```vb
CustomizationContext = NormalTemplate 
For Each aKey In KeyBindings 
 Selection.InsertAfter aKey.Command &amp; vbTab _ 
 &amp; aKey.KeyString &amp; vbCr 
 Selection.Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
Next aKey
```

Use the  **Add** method to add a **KeyBinding** object to the **KeyBindings** collection. The following example adds the CTRL+ALT+H key combination to the Heading 1 style in the active document.




```
CustomizationContext = ActiveDocument 
KeyBindings.Add KeyCategory:=wdKeyCategoryStyle, _ 
 Command:="Heading 1", _ 
 KeyCode:=BuildKeyCode(wdKeyControl, wdKeyAlt, wdKeyH)
```

Use  **KeyBindings** (Index), where Index is the index number, to return a single **KeyBinding** object. The following example displays the command associated with the first **KeyBinding** object in the **KeyBindings** collection.




```
MsgBox KeyBindings(1).Command
```
