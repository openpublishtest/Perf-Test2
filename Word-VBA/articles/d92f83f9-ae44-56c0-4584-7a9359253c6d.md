# Window Object (Word)

Represents a window. Many document characteristics, such as scroll bars and rulers, are actually properties of the window.


## Remarks

The  **Window** object is a member of the **[Windows](377b493b-e73c-0132-869c-3876c3beaef7.md)** collection. The **Windows** collection for the **Application** object contains all the windows in the application, whereas the **Windows** collection for the **Document** object contains only the windows that display the specified document.

Use  **Windows** (Index), where Index is the window name or the index number, to return a single **Window** object. The following example maximizes the Document1 window.




```
Windows("Document1").WindowState = wdWindowStateMaximize
```

The index number is the number to the left of the window name on the  **Window** menu. The following example displays the caption of the first window in the **Windows** collection.




```
MsgBox Windows(1).Caption
```

Use the  **Add** method or the **NewWindow** method to add a new window to the **Windows** collection. Each of the following statements creates a new window for the document in the active window.




```
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.NewWindow 
NewWindow 
Windows.Add
```

A colon (:) and a number appear in the window caption when more than one window is open for a document.

When you switch the view to print preview, a new window is created. This window is removed from the  **Windows** collection when you close print preview.
