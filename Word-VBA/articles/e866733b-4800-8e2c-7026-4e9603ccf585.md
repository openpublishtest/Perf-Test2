# Selection.TypeParagraph Method (Word)

Inserts a new, blank paragraph.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **TypeParagraph**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


## Remarks

This method corresponds to the functionality of the ENTER key. If the selection isn't collapsed to an insertion point, the new paragraph replaces the selection.

Use the  **InsertParagraphAfter** or **InsertParagraphBefore** method to insert a new paragraph without deleting the contents of the selection.


## Example

This example collapses the selection to its end and then inserts a new paragraph following it.


```vb
With Selection 
 .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd 
 .TypeParagraph 
End With
```
