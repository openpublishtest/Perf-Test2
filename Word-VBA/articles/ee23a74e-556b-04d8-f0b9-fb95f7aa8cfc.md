# Email Object (Word)

Represents an e-mail message.


## Remarks

Use the  **[Email](dd4f6a41-3ee6-c1bf-3a2c-e00a342e0009.md)** property to return the **Email** object. The **Email** object and its properties are valid only if the active document is an unsent forward, reply, or new e-mail message.

This example displays the name of the style associated with the current e-mail author.




```
MsgBox ActiveDocument.Email _ 
 .CurrentEmailAuthor.Style.NameLocal
```

The author style name is the same as the value returned by the  **[UserName](96f5ffb6-a20d-96f0-e3a4-0ad2dd47bf99.md)** property.


 **Note**   There is no Emails collection; each **Document** object contains only one **Email** object.
