# Selection.CopyFormat Method (Word)

Copies the character formatting of the first character in the selected text.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **CopyFormat**

 _expression_ Required. A variable that represents a **[Selection](7b574a91-c33e-ecfd-6783-6b7528b2ed8f.md)** object.


## Remarks

If a paragraph mark is selected, Word copies paragraph formatting in addition to character formatting. You can apply the copied formatting to another selection by using the  **[PasteFormat](5c8a69fa-4d07-619c-950a-5ff11fa99003.md)** method.


## Example

This example copies the formatting of the first paragraph to the second paragraph in the active document.


```
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Range.Select 
Selection.CopyFormat 
ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(2).Range.Select 
Selection.PasteFormat
```

This example collapses the selection and copies its character formatting to the next word.




```vb
With Selection 
 .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart 
 .CopyFormat 
 .Next(Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1).Select 
 .PasteFormat 
End With
```
